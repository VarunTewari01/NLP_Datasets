G3Kxhq7gXBZRGK-lo7vPXg,5,"We love Debbie does Doberge so we had to try Debbie on the levee! We were not disappointed. The place has a cute retro diner vibe. We tried the risky biscuit which came with raspberry jam, bacon jam, and whipped butter, a fig and white chocolate dobite, and a slice of cookies and cream doberge. I loved the bacon jam (savory and sweet) as well as the raspberry jam (fresh and tart). The dobite (almost like a petit fore) was excellent as well- the sweetness was tame compared to their other flavors. Lastly, the cookies and cream doberge slice was heavenly. We will be back!",2020-10-25 17:05:00

dhvQGkATeIvvkxoyYtjhig,1,"These guys come around every few months trying to sell me siding or windows. I entertained them one time thinking it could not hurt to get an estimate, but they would not just get down to the task of doing that. Instead the salesman put me on the phone with his supervisor. This seemed weird. After a few minutes of this it became clear they were using the kind of sales tactics designed to wear you down that other reviewers have mentioned. So I handed him back the phone. 

Since then they have knocked on my door at least twice. The most recent time I very politely told them I was not interested and even added ""Have a nice day. Stay safe."" But they would not take no for an answer and every time I tried to go back inside they kept trying to sell me. I don't appreciate being treated like just someone you can sell things to and told him that. Avoid this company.",2020-08-15 15:10:01
6jaYLFWJW3gj2qh4g_Yv3g,5,"La Caleñita this morning made me beat anyone's 800# mark.  We picked up friends around 9:45 AM.  We all live in the Center City on this day a nice quite drive of about 15-20 minutes. It was a beautiful sunny morning with a bit of wind reminding you that winter was just here and if that nature wants it can turn around and makes us miserable in a less than a blink of an eye (shouldn't that be blink of the eyes).

I would tell you that if you are looking for some fancy joint with ultra hot Latin Americans just slightly malnourished so that they fit in their designer outfits and a chic decor this would not be the place.  Is in Northeast Philadelphia on north 5th Street.  Small place hard to find unless you know the colors of the Colombian Flag decorated across the middle with the establishments name.  The group consisted of a good Colombian friend with her husband and my partner and I (also Hispanic).  
I would advise to invite a friend that knows to speak fluent Spanish or you can always point at what you want and go for it as you can see everything through a pastry showcase.  The establishment is set up as a bakery even thought you can get items that you would generally not expect to be served in one.  

If you order coffee make sure that you specify without sugar because all coffee served comes with it included. Of course it comes included I mean they already poured about seven spoons of sugar in your cup.

The food is truly authentic and made fresh. The place is so popular that they need to constantly refill their hot foods. Get there before the after church crowd arrives; trust me.

The tamales are the biggest one's I have seen from here to Bogotá, made with large pieces of chicken inside ,potatoes and peas. They melt in your mouth and are delicious.  
They prepare two kinds of  are arepas to keep it simple the white ones are not sweet and have been sliced through the middle to add the single most important food group: Cheese;  and the yellow ones are sweet.  There is Colombian chorizo which is like a mildly spicy Kielbasa not like the traditional Spanish one. Consider also the empanadas caleñas, orejitas, tres leches, etc. 

The cleanliness of the place is superb. The staff is friendly, courteous and attractive but not starved.  Very inexpensive so do not ignore the tip jar on the counter.  Tipping is not a place in China!!!

Is definite worth the trip!!!",2009-04-05 20:13:54
kxj7TPtJY2zbEjGV0PYfAA,3,"On my ""Visits to the Ballparks of America Tour,"" I recently visited Busch Stadium and quite enjoyed myself.  This stadium had all of the normal, modern amenities but there wasn't anything terribly unique about it, save for the view of the Arch that you get from certain seats and places in the stadium.  

I like stadiums that have things for people to do.  Yes, I like watching baseball games, but if it's two teams I don't necessarily care about, I like to be able to wander around and find things to do.  Unfortunately, Busch Stadium doesn't have much of that happening.  Just a lot of food and beer.

Not even any unique food choices, either.  Some ballparks have local specialties (Philly Cheesesteaks, Clam Chowdah, Elotes, etc.) and apparently Busch Stadium does not.  Only a ton of Budweiser brand beer.  

Tickets are at least cheap enough (this is still a stadium that offers standing-room only tickets and cheaply priced bleacher seats) that you can wander around with your cheap ticket and find another place to sit and no one will kick you out.

Glad I had the opportunity to go and, since it's so close, will probably be back again but this stadium isn't really anything special.",2016-02-06 04:22:36
f5KxH3YahdmVBgS1axPoWg,4,"We had no intentions on going to Snap for lunch on the day we went; the Beau and I had just been wandering south of the area, and after a long stroll through Philly's Magic Garden, we wanted something quick and simple. As we walked back to our hotel, Snap caught my eye. A tad hangry, I decided this was our option. I didn't go in expecting too much...but let me tell you, the bar was raised much beyond my expectations! 

The concept is similar to &pizza in NYC, I found: pick from a menu or pick your own custom toppings, and have it made in a flash! Within ten minute, I had ordered, had two pizzas, and was on my way out the door again! 

He ordered the Margherita, which was wonderfully made: sure, it's just tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and basil, like any other, but the preparation of the crust really sold me on it! It was crisp yet doughy, despite its thinness. Great crust or go home! But...the Bianco Verde...THE BIANCO VERDE...OH. MY. GOD. I am a huge white pizza fan, but this was in another stratosphere! There was shredded mozzarella, housemade fresh mozzerella, ricotta, basil, and HERBED BUTTER. The butter sold it for me. I could have eaten it all by myself...well, I did, but I had to share two bites, which made me sad. Ha! 

This is definitely a place to get excellent pizza fast at a good price. Sitting here in NYC, I'm thinking about that Bianco Verde and wishing I was 100 miles to the south, eating it right now. Don't sleep on this place if you're in Philly! Absolutely worth it!",2017-12-14 18:45:41

NNgQ8fV5ARQgHw-Ob7l50A,1,"Wanna get to your flight on time with the most possible stress? Then Central Airpark is for you. 

Let me set the scene for you - . It's cold out. You think to yourself that there's something strangely comical about arriving at an airport parking lot at 5AM only to see no shuttles in sight and no conceivable signs of life anywhere. As you wait a few minutes and lose faith in the arrival of your savior shuttle, you walk up to the toll window only to see nobody there and no sign indicating whether or not anyone will be there. You will call their phone number only to hear their phone ring from within the office and nobody will come out to assist you. Stricken with panic, you will run back to your car, temporarily forgetting how cold it is, temporarily forgetting all that's been lost about what used to be your humanity. You will pull up to the toll booth to see a heavy gate blocking your way. You will honk. You will honk hoping that the heavens (or at least someone with a way to open this damn gate) will hear you. You will contemplate ramming the gate and using Spot parking (right across the street and looking very much open) so that you can get to your flight on time. In a last ditch effort, you will try the door of the tollkeeper's office and cross the threshold. Inside the belly of the beast - Putting your physical presence inside of this office will awaken the gatekeeper from her humble slumber. She will look at you as if you are the one annoying her - as if you are the one who is possibly invalidating her 400 dollar plane ticket that is not exchangeable and not refundable. You will exchange quick words and she will assure you that the shuttle is on its way. Tired and unwilling to risk any more disappointment, you will reluctantly stay...

...and they will cancel your frequent parker's card. They will ignore any and all attempts for you to get it reactivated. They will conveniently forget that you've been parking here reliably for about 4 years. They will forget all the times you've forgiven them for taking 25 minutes to show up after picking up your luggage. Central Airpark is a poorly-run company with nothing but contempt for its customer base. I've rarely wanted a business to wither and die the way I want this one to.",2013-12-17 14:32:06

My mother is a heavy smoker, so the house had nicotine stains underneath the sofas.  The owner, Dominic went to the house with another technician to do the carpet cleaning.  He did a good job removing the stains, but was not as attentive to the edges of the stairs and closets.  Overall, for the price, he didn't do a bad job.  I would recommend this carpet cleaning company to others.",2015-09-02 07:54:17
FXW16a1QddonpF-h3NtxPg,4,"I am really surprised that I have yet composed  a review for this place. I have been patronizing  this place for years since I started working in Philadelphia. I love the seasonal beers, the service here is top notch, and the staff is super friendly and very attentive to the needs of the customers. 

The menu at Pete's carries the usual bar items,  but it does not taste like your typical  bar food. In addition to the typical bar fare, the menu contains other specialty items like the empanadas that enhances the menu.  The fish & chips  is probably one of my favorite dishes. If you love french fries, you are going to love the french fries at Pete's.

2uzH6U_kGVOBIIJoZOOUPw,4,"BEST CHICKEN SOUP EVER.

Seriously, the soup-making skills of Mama Jovan (let's call her that; I don't actually know her name) are OUT OF THIS FRIGGIN' WORLD. This soup will make you feel like your favorite grandma just hugged you and kissed you and covered you in a crocheted blanket on the couch while slipping you pieces of candy every hour on the hour. It's the cure-all, for sure. The ultimate better-than-your-mom's chicken soup. Fresh meat, flavorful broth, big hunks of carrot. Simple with no frills, as chicken soup should be. And it's served with nearly half a loaf of crusty bread. Oh, and lots of napkins. (Sometimes, I don't even buy napkins for my house when I run out; I call in a food order at Jovan's!)

Other wonderfully delicious items at Jovan's include the bruschetta and the burger. But be warned: the food is prepared as you order, which means it's going to take a while (but taste amazing). If you live nearby and pop in to order your food to-go, don't fret about waiting. Grab a drink at the bar and chat it up with the bartender. He's friendly, as are Mama and her husband, who both work the kitchen.

mMK0ZqT4Y6wmu5tuwPYVxw,1,"Camping World is absolutely inexcusably awful!!! My husband and I went there last night in search of a travel trailer. Geoff seemed to be a very nice and honest salesman at first. But as we were looking at thier inventory, I mentioned that I wanted to look at one other place before we made a decision. His demeanor suddenly changed and he started questioning me as to where else I wanted to look and why. I gave him the name of the other dealership and he his response was ""well we own them"". He then proceeded to express the fact that what we are looking for sells fast so we needed to make a decision
The pressure was on. I asked if we could all look at the inventory on line together and he was happy to help. Come to find out, my husband noticed that the search he did was customized to above our budget. Long story short we ended up giving them a HOLDING deposit of $500 and told that we needed to contact him when the financing got approved prior to them prepping it for sale.
We found a better trailer that would meet our family needs much better for a similar price at another dealership. When we called Geoff at Camping World to inform him of our new find, we were absolutely appalled at his response. He not only was absolutely disrespectful, he threatened to send us a bill for the work that had been done to the trailer, send our information to ""management"" prior to hanging up on us. Please keep in mind, we didn't request any work be done, we never signed any paperwork promising to buy the trailer. 
If that isn't bad enough, we stopped in to get our holding deposit check back and they refused to give it to back to us.
I'm not usually a person that complains about companies or customer service because I know we all have our bad days. But this is absolutely inexcusably wrong!!! Not to mention illegal!!! BBB will be getting a phone call about this.",2021-04-17 03:28:48

5RHa6ARjqHnjkk2puc5y_w,3,"Buck-a-shuck Mondays!  I love how close there is a new oyster house so close to my work building.  It's such a pain getting to center city Oyster House and it's always packed for Happy hour.  Now there is another $1 oyster place in the city.  Doc Magrogan's recently opened and is part of a chain.  Their only weekly special so far is the $1 oysters on Mondays from 4-10pm.  They had four different oysters at this price!  Pretty good deal and the oysters were fresh and nicely shucked.  

We also tried some of their regular menu.  I love me some lobster roll but this was a bit disappointing for me.  Comparing to Oyster House, Doc's lobster roll was lacking.  Their bread to lobster ratio was off and didn't have as much flavor.  The crab cake was just alright.  I appreciate being able to see chunks of crab meat but it wasn't spectacular.  

I have been craving fish and chips for a long time (oh Codmother, I miss you).  Doc's fish and chips was pretty terrible.  The batter had absolutely no flavor.  Can you just imagine eating fried paper?  I had to douse it in tartar sauce.  What a shame.

Definitely come here for Buck-a-Shuck Mondays, everything else needs improvement.",2012-08-07 13:48:32
psAjVE1E1XEYyZ4yTfcdYA,5,"This place was everything I expected it to be. We went on a Friday for lunch and we were greeted as soon as we arrived. I ended up ordering the combo with the classic burger with fries and a drink. That ended up being just about$12 so it wasn't cheap but the quality was there to warrant the higher prices. And let's face it, you pay upwards of $8 at regular fast food places so this wasn't that far off. To me, a delicious burger is all about the bun. The brioche bun was fresh, spongy and tasty. All of the rest of the ingredients were good also. The fries were also really good thanks to all of the dipping sauces. My favorites were the sweet chili and bbq sauce. I'm not too into curry but if you are their Curry ketchup is amazing. I definitely plan on returning. Awesome burger!",2018-02-05 04:40:32

We sat down right away and they brought us menus, then they took our drink orders. But the poor gal working there was there alone for about the first half hour that we were there so she was just trying to juggle 5 tables which I know is hard. But after she took our orders, reinforcements showed up, our food came out quickly PLUS she had 2 additional people to help with the lunch rush. I ordered the General Tso's chicken which came with veggies, fried rice, an egg roll and a soup for an extra $1! Everything was hot, delicious and fresh.

26Jc2vMTOKXGOwTy729a3g,4,"Finally got to go down and check this place out! I went before the hockey game, and it's a great spot to do that. Service and food was very fast, and have lots of little small plates that are very reasonable price wise. We tried a mixed bag for food & a couple different drinks. They have an extensive beer can and draft list so if you're a beer connoisseur this is definitely the place for you.  Sea Change Blonde for me. The Sauv Blanc was nice as well. 

For food we tried to TaQuito's which were absolutely fantastic. Just like the one at 7-Eleven except think fresh homemade, they're filled with ham and cheese with mustard dipping sauce and we're awesome... So good I didn't get a picture! 

We then went with the burger, nacho broccoli, jerk chicken, grilled cheese and pickled eggs. Burger was awesome and you can get one to four patties... Really nice, like a homemade burger. Also that jerk chicken spicing was fantastic. A little bit of heat hits you late, and almost everything on the menu was only $10. I cannot stress the value here it is incredible!

I'll definitely be back for some casual, comfort food, or before the hockey game... Daily specials look really good as well. Great new fun casual place on 10 fourth Street",2019-09-17 17:40:23

_sWha3z3xUK_BXqjl9DPaA,4,"Went here because of all the recent rave reviews on Yelp. I guess it set my expectations too high. I thought the service was good and the price was reasonable. However, I would not give this place 5 stars.

I got a mani and pedi for $40. Made an appointment for Monday at 5pm. Got there at 4:40 and no one was in. I ended up with a Hispanic technician called Isabelle [SP?]. She barely spoke any English but did a scrupulous job on my feet. The hot stone calf massage and the foot massage was nice but only lasted maybe 4 minutes total. I asked her to make the water hotter during the pedicure but she didn't understand me. For the manicure, I got a 1 minute hand massage and another 1 minute neck massage after she had shaped my nails and clipped my cuticle. Felt really good but again, short. 

What I didn't like was that my technician went rough with he cuticle pusher.  I ended up getting a cut on my right pinky. It still hurts and still stings 3 days later! It was also weird that they asked me to pay first before I got my nails painted. The worst part about the experience was that everyone in the establishment was dead silent except for the owners that were playing on the iPads and the only tv that was there was put on some lame beauty infomercial channel. The whole atmosphere felt sorta tense. No one made any conversation. Also, I was not offered anything to drink.

The whole ordeal took maybe an hour and 15 minutes. My manicure was done with Essie and Opi Polish and it already chipped. I have to try gel next time. Overall, Isabelle did not do a bad job but I just didn't feel relaxed or especially pampered from the experience.",2015-11-13 00:33:20

One of the best things I ever put in my mouth. The house Bloody Mary had me saying Hail Marys after every sip it was soooo good. And the service was exceptional. Our waiter was quick, not hovering and friendly. And the table next to us was a group of fabulous wig wearing dolls out for a bachelorette. Their waitress didn't skip a beat.

arClkvdti1PnM2vhILmFeg,2,"I'll spare the details concerning how we came to agree on a new roof.  It's honestly the same except instead of a Sam's Club or BJ's, they canvassed some neighborhoods.  We were interested in a new roof anyway.

The sales pitch is long.  I told our sales guy that I was okay with the material, polypropylene woven fiber, because I was familiar with it due to my profession.  I knew it wouldn't be cheap.  That said, he told me it was required that he finish his sales pitch even if I was okay with the price and the materials.  But that's not what the 2 stars is for since I'm okay with people doing their jobs.  There were a few issues, two I consider major, which is the cause of this poor review.

The small issue was that we needed to contact our insurance for an inspection first.  Because of that we scheduled the repair 2 weeks out, but then within a couple of days the manager for the actual work was at our home and tried to schedule it for just a few days after that.  So either the sales guy didn't know this would happen or knew and lied.  If he didn't know?  Then they need better communication or they risk annoying some customers, like me!  They need to give people time to get their financial and insurance stuff together if they care as much as they claim! 

Their sales pitch is that their employees are not day labor, wear hard hats and harnesses as PPE, physically cover the side of your home and make sure everything is directly disposed and there is no debris all over your yard.  The first crew to show up that was tearing up the roof wore no PPE and covered NOTHING in our yard!  They just threw a piece of tarp down - didn't even straighten it out- and then just threw it near the tarp.  This brings me to issue #2: debris was falling into our AC unit and my husband had to tell them to cover it.  Their covering was to lean a piece of particle board against it which is nothing like what they show you during their sales pitch.  So don't believe this BS hype because that's all it is!  The group of guys actually putting the roof on wore a harness, but no hard hats.  Luckily they are insured, but I took pics using my home camera of their work to be safe.  My husband also went out into the yard and took some pics while they were doing work.  

And the last reason they get 2 stars?  We found a small issue within the week, my husband called to talk their warranty group and left a message.  They never returned our call.  I has been taken care of, but they should return their customer's calls especially within a week of a new install.  

They didn't replace any interior beams like they said they would though.  The sales guy and another inspector marked several beams they claimed they would replace - this is just another BS sales pitch since they only replaced one!  So don't buy their claims about upgrading all of your old or damaged roofing.  Don't even use them because they use polypropylene (PP) - get several opinions and go with whatever you want.  They try to make it sound like they stand out and are different from beginning to end, but the only difference I can see is the polymer instead of tar paper.  Other than this, the roof looks fine and most of the people we dealt with were nice.",2020-03-01 03:41:27

I had the pan-seared blackened drum, and oh my, it was probably the best dish I've ordered from a restaurant, and this was one of the best meals I've had while in LA. I love mushroom risotto, and theirs were flavorful and had a good consistency. I never thought mushroom risotto would pair well with a white fish, but the flavors complimented each other. The meat of the fish was slightly firm and flaky. The dish has just a good amount of saltiness. The lemon beurre blanc sauce was a nice addition, and I'm glad that the sauce wasn't too lemony. Overall, it was a very delicious and memorable dish, and if I lived in LA, that would've been my go-to from this café.",2021-10-16 17:24:46

h_erVp39Nr3tjZxEJk-6NQ,4,"Four stars for a decent size Latin grocer that happens to serve some pretty solid food. 
This is probably the most well stocked Latin grocer that I have come across since moving down to Clearwater. They have everything you would want to make a great cinco de mayo party including a piñata if the margaritas make you aggressive (they don't sell tequila). 
They have rows of beans, tortillas, sauces, fresh poblanos, avocados, along with a great selection of dried spices and peppers. 
I tried three different types of tacos with the steak being on point but the chorizo and pastor not holding up to others in the area. All in all they weren't the best tacos but I would come back for them and at 1.99 each it was a generous portion of filling. 
It is a bit intimidating if you do not know Spanish as the hand written menu is only in Spanish but the very polite lady that took my order will gladly translate it for you if you ask. 
They have plenty of seating inside so you can get the order to go or eat there. 
I will definitely be back as each time I've gone it has a good crowd ordering some food and/or getting groceries.",2017-01-22 16:44:20

The laundry facilities don't work half the time. It took me two weeks to move in from the actual move in date because of the leaking ceiling which they waited ALL day to inform me. 3 months later the ceiling started leaking again. There are termites everywhere and in the laundry facility!! I'm absolutely appalled. I should've ran at the first sign of move in but I didn't think it would be all downhill from here.

g0_x4kVvJAYuk96oCcbOmw,2,"So, I stopped by tonight with some friends and we were cut off from the downstairs bar by a forced invitation to the upstairs lounge. Normally not an issue, but one of our company had muscular dystrophy and stairs were a challenge. We assisted our friend up in expectation of the fantastic beverages that were to come. Tonight especially, a taste of 'Root'; the new locally brewed spirit.

We sat at the very small upstairs bar and were given samples of root. It was very nice, a bit sweet for me, and discussed the possibility of mixing it with a prosecca to enhance the base flavors and tone down the sweet.

Unfortunately for us, Nick and Christian were no where to be found, so our discussions were for naught. The waitress who assisted us had no mixology skill, and Sam, the official barkeep, said not ONE WORD to us the hour we were there, nor did he bother to make a drink for us or inquire if we wanted one.

The waitress ended up making our drinks, which we agreed were lame and tame compared to the vivid flavors we are used to from this place. We considered a second round, but after waiting for fifteen minutes with dry glassware I finally gave in and tendered my credit card, paying forty five (yes $45) dollars for the three drinks we had. 

When we first starting coming here, drinks were great, service was brilliant, and we were excited to be part of the Apothecary scene. It sadly seems that as the name has shrunk, so have all other aspects of this bar/lounge, except the price. (The hours have even been cut to wed-sun!)

Sorry Tony, just as we had to walk away from RAW when you cut back the quality, we now have to walk away from here.

We are outside due to COVID and the inside being pretty busy/full, there were more people than I was comfortable with being around. The outside dining was completely empty, probably in part being the chilly weather. On that particular evening the wind was blowing right down 1st and the dining is completely unprotected. 

The food: I ordered the 1st Ave, Candy Cane and Mexican rolls. All were delicious and discounted since we dined on a Monday (their happy hour day). We ordered the jalapeño w/tuna appetizer recommended by my friend who had it before.

Yes, I'm one of those who can tell if something was pre-made. Also, they made sure they were very careful for allergies. Tough to come by for sure!!

She explained that they have fresh chef inspired lunch and dinner specials everyday. Their chef tends to have more Asian infused influences. I thought that was kind of unique. We tried the buffalo chicken flatbread which was super good! Personally I like the extra thin crispy crust if I eat flatbreads at all. This one was superb! 

My husband ordered the chicken Caesar salad. Chicken, diced egg and croutons lay on whole romaine leaves. Wow! It looked amazing. Hubby said he would order again in a heartbeat. I ordered chicken tortilla salad. It was by far the freshest chicken and veggies I've had in a chain type restaurant. The chicken definitely has never been frozen. 

I'm so ecstatic I found this neighborhood bar/grille. We can not wait for Sunday brunch. The chef prepares a fresh new menu every Sunday.

5QRQJNdt3p6E7FWR9FEX3A,5,"Welcome to the coffee version of Cheers...The Mocha Nut Coffee Shop, where everyone knows your name!

This locally owned coffee shop on the south side prides itself on getting to know their customers. Every time I walk in I get greeted by name! The baristas are so nice and friendly - very sweet folks. Luckily they are not just nice, but make some great coffee! 

Per my first review, I still love the lavender latte. Their seasonal lattes have been fun to try (fall was my favorite). My staple is a pour over. They have two consistent ones and then a rotating brew. Right now it's a Tinker coffee. The consistent ones are medium or dark roast but usually the rotating one is light (which I vastly prefer!). 

The seating is great! This place is usually pretty busy, as a head's up, most of the time. They have some comfy sitting chairs in a couple corners, have a high table with stools running across the window, and tables of varying sizes. The high tables and a couple of the corner areas have outlets, so bring your charger if you're working or studying on a laptop. 

During warmer weather, you'll want to try the patio at the back of the shop. It's delightful and adorable! 

They have an online order option, both a website and an app. Usually takes only 10-15 min for your brew to be ready. Sometimes they even write nice things on your to-go cup! :) 

The snacks are good as well - their pumpkin muffin is surprisingly great (I am surprised only because I usually hate that flavor) but their chocolate chip cookies are my favorite. 

Parking is great, with spots in front, on the side, and behind the shop. There's a door at the back of the shop so feel free to park in the back. 

Also important for folks who plan to be there a couple hours: bathrooms are really nice and clean. 

Anyways, this is my top coffee shop in the city and we are very lucky to have this within the chain-store happy south side (within a 2 mile radius are 3 Starbucks).",2021-12-17 00:47:58

-two new tires
-windshield wipers
-air filter
-steering alignment
So that'll be $300 please. 

HMMMM. 

I said, an alignment? You just aligned them 6 weeks ago (had this done, same location, in November) They said oh, well just recommend it. I said, is it really in need of a realignment? He said, I don't know. I said ""can't you tell?"" he said no. Hmmm so if you can't tell how do you know I need this $80 service? Just wondering. 

For the record, I take good care of my car and it has less than 25K miles on it, the filter is fine, the wipers work well, just had them on yesterday and there they were, wiping their little hearts out. The tires, as soon as I got home I checked the treads and they totally passed the penny test.

I'll say, for a brief period, my heart ached, and I do still pine for a beef burrito. But that being said, when I built the courage to go to Honest Tom's again a few months back, I couldn't believe the new product. So many places that switch to plant based, end up just trying to figure out how to make something taste as similar to meat as possible. Honest Tom's does so well because they are building meal options that are specific culinary items. The Biff burrito is not simply a beef replacement, it's an entity by itself. It has a totally different flavor profile than the original beef burrito in the best way possible. You can absolutely tell that tons of time was taken to really evaluate how to make the most of the switch-over, and although I do miss some of their original options, their new options are absolutely great ones.",2019-04-28 17:39:34

 Came here for a New Year's Eve dinner. Made a last minute reservation so only outdoor seating available. Since it was NYE As expected service wasn't 100%. We understood. I was thoroughly impressed with the food for dinner. I've been for brunch 3 times and this is my 1st dinner experience. I wasn't expecting the dinner items to be so good because when I think of the library, just like their sister restaurant  Oxford Exchange,  I think about great brunch food. My boyfriend and I agreed we may like them better for dinner rather than brunch.  Our favorite dish that took us by surprise was the  benne cauliflower -sweet Thai chili roasted cauliflower. Perfection of sweet and spicy. One of the best cauliflower dish we've had and we've had some great ones at On Swann for example.  We split an entree--the jumbo sea scallop served with  gouda grits, pork belly brussels sprouts and corn purée (34 dollars). The scallops did smell a little fishy  so not the freshest but they were huuuge, cooked well and just  really buttery soft. The grits were amazing. Grits was thick almost like a polenta but so smooth and creamy and flavorful. We loved it! Mussels had  nduja sausage, fennel, leeks, bouillabaisse broth, grilled baguette (18 dollars),l. Wish there was more bread and wish there was more sausage. It was good but not great.  We asked for more bread but it never came (and we understood Mussels smelled fresh. We commented that we've had better mussels  other places that are served in a similar tomatoe broth cream sauce. Felt like the broth  didn't pack that flavor punch we were expecting especially since it had sausage.  

Creme brûlée (12 dollars) was good but wasn't a fan of the poached apples. Bread pudding (11 dollars) is my favorite dessert. Bread pudding was good but a bit overcooked. For me a perfect bread pudding has a  hard  crust but soft within that hard crust/ crispy brown edges. It was a bit thick / dense. Nonetheless I still enjoyed it, because even a bad bread pudding is still pretty decent.  I really liked the Terrapin Luau Passion Fruit-Orange-Guava IPA.",2020-02-19 22:32:05

I got the boss hog cooked medium rare and had them add an egg to it. On the side I got sweet potato fries and the 420 shake. The burger was unbelievable from presentation to consumption. Meat was cooked perfect, bun was soft and the size was just right. Massive onion rings, pork belly and a sunny side up egg al blended perfectly with the bbq sauce on there. The fries were great. I normally go for hand cut fries but that was not an option and I was surprisingly not disappointed with the sweet waffle fries. 

I wasn't crazy about the shake. It looked good but wasn't as thick as I wished it would have been. It was a lot of whipped cream and not so much ice cream.

.....what was I going to say?

blackened grouper.

So, if you haven't picked up by now, I obviously ordered the fish and chips. (What?!) jk I ordered the blackened grouper. OOH.. *whistle* it was so. Good. Perfectly seasoned, guys. I mean, perfectly. Not overly salty. Had some garlic and onion goin' on in there, maybe some paprika. And a tad bit of subtle sweetness that had my mouth wanting MORE. And such a decent amount! It was so good. Even the beans and rice were good! Tender rice with seasoned beans. Fresh pico de gallo. And this FISH oh Lord this fish.

So good. Let's just say....If I could only subsist on fish alone...and I also lived right next to Badfins Food + Brew...and I also had lots of money.

I would eat this. Every. Day. And get ALL the Omega 3's and 6's that this world has to offer! 

Definitely a fantastic place to stop in and eat at if you are ever in the area!  After you stuff yourself with fish you can swim like a fish amongst fishes....

fpiirm8MU_hSJBjHpbtIUA,4,"So, it looks like they're back open, but with a very limited menu.  They've got a re-opening special going, that's $5 (plus tax, cash only) where you get miso, and your choice of katsu (deep fried pork loin) and curry, karage (deep fried chicken) and curry, or just plain curry.

The miso that came out wasn't your standard tofu and seafood miso - this miso was packed with pieces of pork, carrots, yams, fish cake, etc.  I thought I took a picture, but apparently did not since it's not on my phone . . . whoops.

I got the katsu, which is hard to mess up - deep fried, lightly breaded with panko, and served on a bed of shredded cabbage with some tonkatsu sauce in a ramikin.  This came on a small, rectangle plate.

Curry came in a big bowl - white rice, and a generous service of curry on top and to the side.  No fancy presentation here - just a bowl with rice thrown in, and curry dished over it.  I don't know much about Japanese curry.  My only experience with it is that growing up, we probably had the S&B Golden Curry that you can find at most well-stocked groceries now at least once a month, and I still make it occasionally.  In any case, I liked it.  I'm used to having Japanese curry with the bright yellow, pickled daikon, and I know when I had the curry here before, they offered the pink, pickled daikon (and being Korean, we always had kimchi with it too).  In any case, none was offered, and I didn't think to ask.

I did ask if they were planning on going back to their full menu, and the woman working the front of the house said they were hoping to - I got the feeling she didn't know for sure or the timeline for a shift back to ramen is unknown, so she was dancing around the question a little.

Tonkatsu and curry are both close to comfort food for me - they're generally known quantities, and items we'd have at home growing up.  The food here reminded me of those simple meals at home.

Definitely hoping they get back into the ramen business, but even with just curry, I'll be returning.",2014-04-11 16:05:57
NNgQ8fV5ARQgHw-Ob7l50A,4,"Dear (South)Korea, 

You sure are looking smug these days.  Why is that?

Is it because of that sweet magic you puled off with Kim Yu-Na at the Olympics?

Is it your current World Cup team, who seems to blow up the facebook status updates of my friends every time they so much as sneeze?

Is it your liberal use of TADs in the field of Orthodontics and the crazy final results you get, nonsurgically?

It could be all of those things, but let's face it.  I know why you look so smug - you've won my stomach over.

It was a tough battle.  I know that little over a year ago, I tried an item called fish cake at a Korean restaurant.  I wasn't really impressed by it, but that is probably what I got for going in cold and ordering seemingly at random.  This experience put a damper in my appreciation of your cuisine for quite a while and for that I apologize.  I should not have been so foolish.

Over the many months, you'd spring up once in a while, throwing a bi bim bap or kimchee my way.  I had colleagues who would try to set us up at various restaurants and Korean associates would feed me some homemade items.  Even though I always liked you(especially your BBQ skills), I wasn't ready to let you get a secure foothold in my eating itinerary.  Life was just too complicated.  We were friends, but not the kind that called frequently to hang out.

After Koreana, something changed.  Things suddenly got serious.  My regular Thai and Japanese go-tos now had a serious competitor.  Places like H-Mart, Miga, and some-Korean-BBQ-place-I-Can't-Remember-The-Name-of paved the way, but Koreana sealed the deal and solidified my serious enthusiasm for Korean food.

Koreana did the following things really freaking well:
Dol sot bi bim bap - very tender beef, egg, and really fresh tasting veggies stirred all together with rice in a clay pot.  After you add the hot sauce to this, you will realize that you sit before something awesome.  If you don't like this hot sauce, you should apologize for your behavior to any friends you have remaining because you are probably an asshole.

Kimchi bokeum bop - Spicy fried rice dish with chopped kimchee and egg.  Really great.

Goon mandu - Fried pork and veggie dumplings.  They are good but comparable to dumpings that can be achieved at other Asian food restaurants.

Jaeyook dup bap - meat and veggies in a thicker, spicy sauce.  

Oh yeah, and the items were pretty darn cheap and pretty darn fast and their hot sauce...oh, be still my beating heart.  It was excellent.

So you see, (South)Korea, your cuisine will be getting many more of my dining dollars in the years to come.  It has been a long road, but one that I'm happy to have traveled.  

Sincerely,
Brad P.",2010-06-19 12:12:14

Constantly being the odd man out I tend to gravitate toward chill joints where locals hang to shoot the shit.  From day one in Ybor I found myself hanging out at the Tampa Bay Brewing Company.

For lunch I've done the inside part (AC is a beautiful thing while in business casual), but at night I hit the outside bar.  Surrounded by regulars, drunk stumblers and a parade of randomness, I thoroughly enjoy my time here.  

I've tried the porter, stout, blonde and red-eye and loved all of them.  The food also rocks socks with solid burgers (done perfectly medium rare) and wings that will blow out your colon (ask for the Hellfire sauce).

No matter where I wander in Ybor, I'm bound to end up at Tampa Bay Brewing.  Cool as hell bartenders and the kind of odd shit that only happens when you've hugged a bar stool for too long.

5kcLlhJPLJL_GLwrAdbZAA,2,"My drinks were great, but my food was quite bland. My friend Ken and I ordered the buttermilk fried persimmons, pork belly and root veggie empanadas, and coffee rubbed beer braised short rib. I expected the persimmons to be sweet, but they were devoid of any flavor, so much so that they tasted like turnips. Sadly, the accompanying marinated red peppers were the highlight of this dish. They actually had flavor. The empanadas were filled with pork belly, which is usually full of flavor, but was sadly lacking here. The root veggies made the filling even more bland. Now the piece de resistance... the short rib was fork tender, but the sauce was too bitter for its own good. The accompanying brown butter brussel sprouts were even more bitter. To taste two bitter components in the same dish doesn't work for me. I feel that this is where something like brown butter carrots would've balanced out the bitter sauce. There were carrots in the mashed potatoes, but not enough to balance the bitterness. I'm quite disappointed in the food. I think there is potential for this food to be amazing with the right spices and then we wouldn't need the salt and pepper shakers and bottle of hot sauce they brought over to our table.",2018-10-21 05:40:46

2YKkLFeOx-0zRcWp0KUv_Q,4,"A few visits in now, here's my rundown:

What I don't like:
The bar stools -  they are attached to the ground. If you're not normal sized (like me) sitting at the bar is VERY uncomfortable.

What I like:

The vibe -  cornhole, ping pong and other activities to entertain you while you partake of the beverage of your choice and hang with family or friends.
The service -  we've gotten our food fast and last time they forgot to sub my salad for the requested soup. They rectified it by giving me a cup of soup for free.  
The food - My wife and I ordered different burgers so we could split them and try both... the Pub and the M.A.C. The Pub burger was supposed to come with havarti, BBQ sauce and bacon... only they forgot the bacon. Huh? How does that happen? Once it was added it was a good burger. The M.A.C. is a shameless reincarnation of the same thing as that place with the golden arches... only CD's version is WAY better. My wife and I agreed if we go back, that's what it would be for.

What I love:

The pretzel bites with provolone fondue. . You have to be extremely careful not to fill up on these if you order them as an appetizer. I'm also pretty fond of the beer selection and drinks in general. Their cocktails are creative and tasty.

All in all, there's little to complain about here (except the bar stools). It'll definitely be someplace that stays on our radar when we're looking for someplace outside our usual rotation of places.",2018-08-06 16:45:18

First, pet peeve.  Hot Chocolate served with ""whipped topping (AKA Cool Whip in an aerosol can)"" is disgusting.  Pile of white grease on top of my cocoa.  Ugh.  Spend the extra twenty cents to buy real whipped cream, would ya?

French toast was fine.  Belgian waffle was...chewy.  Rubbery. Not interested in absorbing butter or syrup.  Odd.  In a not really appetizing way.

P6qIQ6pKtPDzeDoT2y1chQ,1,"November 1, 2013 1-hour Photo center, between 4 &5 pm.  

The Tall, scraggly, VERY hairy, & almost middle aged guy.  You know who you are.

  I tried to purchase photos for a friend, but was rudely, and uncomfortably questioned  ""Did you take these?""  when some of them ""looked professional"".  I was not the photographer, however, my knowledge to purchasing these photos was 100 % legal and my right to purchase was taken from me.  I was refused purchase unless I could show proof of copy-right of the photos. 

I was trying to surprise a friend by decorating her apartment with photographs of her and her family.  I was given copies of these photographs to print.  There are only 2 cases here.  

1. The photographer was not a professional so, no copy-right receipt exists, thus making it impossible to convince this dim-witt employee that its legal for me to buy the photos.

 2.  The pictures were from a professional, but the photos were not proofs & they had no copy-right restriction printed on the photo.  And since my friend's family has other copies and prints of the photos they share at home and facebook, my guess in this case the copy-right has been purchased.

Ultimately, I shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable or be treated rudely when it comes to purchasing photos.  I was doing nothing wrong but trying to be thoughtful for a friend.  I was wrongfully accused of trying to commit a crime.

EbzIOck2feoZrGxRjyPDyw,4,"This place has a good vibe. It's my Irish pub of choice in Rittenhouse. Much more Irish-y than its neighbor, the Irish Pub. The latter isn't a bad choice in itself - I just prefer the Bards.

Anywhoo, it's your standard bar set in a Philly row. They have a good selection of local beers on their northernmost tap, and a kitschy whiskey dispensing tap mounted on the wall that looks like it was DIY'd, but with talent. They've also got your light beers on tap closer to the dart board, you pansy.

The food here is always changing. I've had a rotation of pub grub standards (chicken fingers, fries, etc) here, and between the breading changing, the fries being spiced/unspiced, and the curry being awesome/mediocre, the food averages out to 3/5. Tasty and satisfying enough to order, but nothing you should feel compelled to try.

Here's to the Bards staying chill.

Pro-tip: 3 dollar Yards pints at Happy Hour and late night (I think). Basically, every time I'm here (usually late night), Yards is almost always on special.

Bonus points: the jukebox has Michael Jackson's ""The Lady in My Life."" HUGE plus for me. The song doesn't really fit the mood of the place, but it's good to know it's an option if I want to feel pretty.",2011-01-11 15:41:36

You could tell there is some high level expertise and attention to details in how they craft their food offerings. Also, they've got a great selection of market goods. They've got kewpie mayo too!

5 stars - Chili oil. In the fridge they've got this chili oil that is soo good. The flavor profile is complex, it doesn't shy away from a nice spice level, and it has these fried onions in it that make it the perfect pairing to fresh steamed rice. And the chili oil is good on their bread too. 

5 stars - Bread bake. Their bread is exactly as described. When they call it a baguette it's the texture and crisp you expect. Any of their sourdough loafs are what you'd expect, a good chew and the air bubbles from a fermented dough. 

5 stars - Cookies. Their cookie flavor combos are so complementary. Depending on the cookie type, they can be crispy or chewy, so it really gives options to different type of cookie eaters. 

5 stars - Pastries. With the standard pastry options, they have different savory and sweet options too, and are unique from what you'd find elsewhere. I really appreciate that. Every time I go I can try something new. 

5 stars - Farmer's market. They can also be found at the Broad Ripple farmers market. Their goods sell out fast there, but it's nice that they go a little north so it's not too far of a drive for me to their downtown location.",2021-12-13 04:24:06

Then he hands me the phone, and she starts naming off things we didn't even ask for or wanted. The first order was a medium pizza with creamy garlic ranch sauce with chicken, bacon, and pineapple. She was literally stuck on the creamy garlic ranch part for over 3 mins. Kept saying different sauces that I DIDN'T WANT. Then I say with chicken, bacon, and pineapple.

I am pretty unfamiliar with Taiwanese cuisine but was lucky to have few Taiwanese friends in our group to explain the items on the menu. However, don't hesitate to ask the server questions since the menu doesn't have much detail. The servers are pretty friendly and are willing to help you figure out what you're craving. While the majority of the group ordered the beef noodle soup, I decided to order the stewed chicken which was incredibly delicious and definitely satisfied my cravings. The stewed chicken came in a stone pot accompanied with a bowl of rice. The chicken was steamy hot over the boiling wine/ginger sauce. One thing I wish I could change about the dish is making it a little easier to eat. I was picking at the mini bones in between bites.

Some Yelpers and I came here after the Fit Club event because the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed for the day. We were here later (probably 730ish) and the place was pretty quiet. 

We ordered some drinks. Two of the four got beer, the other two split a bottle of wine. They don't have a huge wine list, but they have a few reds and whites, a small selection of domestic and foreign beers, and some standard cocktails. 

We ordered food, got the peppercorn fries to share. I had a few bites and they were pretty good. The gravy was rich and peppercorns added a nice bite. There is grated cheese on the dish, but it's not poutine because they're not cheese curds. I really appreciate the fact Blue Rare didn't try to falsely advertise this dish as poutine. 

I got the blackened chicken. It's a cajun spiced grilled chicken breast topped with a fruit salsa. The chicken was nice, a little spice but not unbearable and pretty moist (even with the blackened part it certainly wasn't burnt). The fruit salsa was good but there was hardly any on the chicken, it amounted to a few diced pineapple pieces on top. More salsa, even a small dish would have been nice. 

It comes with cooked veggies, which were the most random veggies, a cooked carrot, piece of grilled corn, one piece of steam broccoli and cauliflower.

Ue73_1P2yN_1_HJvEmgzOg,5,"I was hesitant bc of the prices; I usually eat at Indian buffets because I can try a lot of different things and get a varied taste for the cuisine. However, this ended up being totally worth it. The decor was inviting, the bathrooms impeccable and the menu was awesome and well-explained.

I went with someone who doesn't enjoy curry (so we've never gotten to eat Indian food together); he was sort of set on disliking Indian cuisine. Raul came to the rescue. I ordered samosa as an app & it was divine; the veggies inside were more ground than I'm used to but right away I could tell the flavors were complex. It was almost like one could taste a lot of different flavors, but not all at once. 

Raul insisted we try the garlic naan (NOT a mistake) & made my co-diner a lamb dish that was off the menu (maybe a variation of the Vindaloo or the Patthar Gosht- I can't remember!), sans curry. 

I went with the Navratan Korma. It was mind-blowingly delicious and worth every penny. Yet again with my entree, the flavors and textures of the sweet fruits and veggies like cauliflower and the bits of almond revealed themselves in layers, with a bit of sumptuous heat remaining. Every bite was something to savor. 

In the end, there was enough for us to take home & reheat later, and Raul even told us how to ideally box it to take with us. My only request: more naan per serving! I'm used to naan coming with the dish, and being refillable, and I really would love it if they moved in that direction (hint hint guys- your naan is awesome!).

bJ5FtCtZX3ZZacz2_2PJjA,5,"First a cool history lesson (thank you Wikipedia) -

""Norman ""Sailor Jerry"" Collins (born 1911, died 1973) is considered the foremost American tattoo artist of his time. He expanded the array of colors available by developing his own safe pigments. He created needle formations that embedded pigment with much less trauma to the skin, and he was one of the first to utilize single-use needles and hospital-quality sterilization. His attention to detail was so precise that the riggings in his nautical tattoos were perfectly accurate. He regarded tattoos as the ultimate rebellion against ""the Squares"".""

And Now The Review -

This store was incredible when it was in Old City, and now that it's moved it's even bigger. Picture a cool fashion store where you can get clothing with designs that are based on one of the most legendary tattoo artists ever? it can be on the expensive side a lot of times, but think about how many clothing stores sell items that are cheap knock offs to tattoo art. This stuff is the real deal! they also sell cool buckles, glasses, zippos, and other merchandise. sometimes they have cool stuff in a sales rack.

Unlike some other places, I've never felt like I was being scolded for one thing or another (which is why I used to not like going to the dentist in the first place).

The office itself is extremely well located on Haddon Avenue across from the train station. It's just a short walk away from where I live. It's always been easy to get to my appointment and then the train to get in to work afterward. Thanks to Dr. Lisko and his staff, I don't really dread going to the dentist anymore.",2015-07-02 17:15:53

rhndkISGojCLXT9FC6A8iA,4,I ordered via UberEATS tonight and even though there were a few hiccups the food was delicious. The estimated delivery time was around 45 minutes and it took closer to 80 minutes because they forgot to include a wide. High five for good customer service for including an additional side dish to make up for it at no cost though. The food really was delicious and I assumed it had sat for sometime due to the mishap. We will definitely order here again and I prefer this place to Northern Chicken.,2017-06-03 04:40:25

The gym caters to practitioners of all skill levels (gi and no gi) so there are classes focused on building foundations for beginners as well as classes for higher belts looking for ways to improve their game. 

Are you someone who wants to compete in tournaments?  Great. There are a bunch of guys and gals to train and match intensity with. Just looking to have fun, get a good workout and pick up some self defense along the way? Cool. There are a lot of us in that camp as well. Either way, the gym is super inviting and friendly to newcomers of all ages. 

The owner, Lane, is a down to Earth guy who has loads of knowledge and tons of stories from his fighting days. The fundamentals class is taught by John, a very humble and patient blackbelt. Both gentlemen are excellent teachers who want to see their students improve.",2019-06-08 19:43:21

The service was good. Our server was attentive but not in our face all the time. We started with the guacamole and it was not good. Being that we are from California we both agreed the guac was missing something. Lime or lemon, or salt or something. It kinda just tasted like straight avocados. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and it was delicious. It was juicy and crisp and perfectly seasoned. Definitely will go and order that again.

I decided to order the same thing with shrimp, it came out to $15 for a large order and a 20 minute wait. No big deal, I'm getting my oil
Changed across the way. Got my soup, she said come back again to try everything else.

When we got there, they asked us to come back so they could fix it. No, we can't, we just drove 5 hours to get here. It took hours for them to ""fix"" most things, but the toilet was still broken. They were going to ship us the part so we could get back on the road. On our walk through I asked why there was only one battery when there was a spot for two. They said they are only required to give us one battery. On our first trip, I'm driving down the road and the RV is SMOKING! We pull over and the guys in the shop had zip tied the positive and negative connectors to the FRAME because they were too cheap to give me a second battery. What did Camping world do after 15 calls and speaking to two managers?? NOTHING! They wanted me to take the RV back (another 10 hour round trip drive) to prove they did it, and I didn't.

We again received excellent service and had wonderful food!  Mr. Hoque waited on us.  As before we had great conversation with him.  He is very good at making food and wine suggestions.  I am vegan and he helped me navigate the menu.  I had the eggplant dish which was very good.  We also tried a bread we had not had before that had mint in it.  Also delicious.  My husband had a lamb dish that looked to have spinach in it.  He seemed to enjoy it very much.  For an appetizer I had the potato pakora.  My better half had the meat samosa.  If memory serves, the wine that was suggested was a malbec wine and went perfectly with our dinner.  We had plenty of food left over to take home, but I admit I wish we had ordered more to take with us just because I missed the food so much once it was gone.  =)  

The food at Saffron is a little different than other Indian restaurants I have been to, but I have never been to two that were exactly alike.  The owner is from Bangladesh which makes the food more unique than the others in which I have dined.  Saffron is definitely one of my/our very favorite restaurants!  We will have to order extra food next time so that we can have our favorites as well as try some of the things on the menu we have never had before.  I would like to try some things from the Indo-Chinese section.  I would also love to try their lunch buffet sometime if I ever wake up early enough to go.  =)

HwL0cUMC7-qghiAKBzMpXg,4,"Going to The Barnes Foundation BEFORE they allowed you to take photos and AFTER was as different as night and day. 
I previously held off reviewing The Barnes as a museum because of the really bizarre experience I'd had
Seriously, the guards were all over us the last time I was there and not being able to take photos (for fun, or for reference) really detracted from our visit (along with their crappy solution for conveying information about the pieces in each room.) 

Fast-forward to my most recent jaunt, when I specifically when to see a special exhibit when I realized that the photography ban was lifted and that not only were there more people, but there were more people talking, taking pictures, looking at the reference materials and looking like they were enjoying themselves. 

The lack of information to the visitor is still a major problem for me. I like what I like, so I don't really love guided tours in museums - but I want to know what I'm looking at (hence the 4 stars) particularly due to the nature of the Barnes collection. 
The only reference for any of the art is available solely on these laminated cards stored inside the benches in each room. And they copied the original layouts of the room and Barnes wall ensembles, so there'll never be any real 'signage' but you need to do better.  
Either create the world's most robust app (current app - very meh) to remain unobtrusive so people know what they're looking at, OR print a robust, worthwhile museum guide for visitors to carry on their journey and take home with them. 

Because (confusion aside) the collection itself is very cool. 
Pieces aren't here because they're works by famous artists -- they're here because of what Barnes himself saw in each piece. The man had boots on the ground in Europe, seeking out art himself, and amassed the collection on his own. Other museums existed during this time but no one else had someone there like Barnes himself was, learning more about the art, tracking pieces down and really seeing the value in some of the most popular styles of art now before anyone else did.

More helpful details: There is coat & bag check in the basement (as well as lockers) along with a small but decent gift shop. The bathrooms were a bit of a hot mess both times I was there which, should be something they might want to look into dealing with.",2018-11-09 19:59:06

ZDCWEctaQHfJQT1sH_rMmA,3,"We hired Sierra to redesign and re-landscape our yards which were hit hard by the drought. They had great ideas, but the execution as a whole fell short due to a pattern of inconsistency. 

My parents have a tract home with an average-sized yard for Goleta. We needed the bulk of the existing landscape demo'd, with the exception of a few trees and hardscape items. When Jose came to provide an initial estimate, we found him to be a friendly guy and were excited over the idea of our yards being transformed into the oasis we'd long envisioned. Seven months later, this three-month job is still under construction. 

We appreciated how the work was billed in tiers. Rather than paying the full amount all at once, my parents would pay a bit at a time for the portion of work done. On that note, Sierra's bid was less expensive than some other landscapers we'd interviewed, which we also enjoyed. 

As evidenced by the photos, Sierra delivered quality craftsmanship. The plants and lawn are coming in beautifully, the landscape lighting looks gorgeous at night, and the raised planter beds are just what we wanted.

However, much of the initial momentum waned after month two or so. There would be weeks at a time with no work done - we did have a rain storm early on in 2019, but the timing on this didn't exceed three weeks. We were informed that there were several other current jobs on Sierra's pipeline, and never really felt like our project was a priority for them. It was a matter of my dad prodding Sierra to follow through with the procedure. For instance, when the lawn was installed, there was a two month delay before the irrigation was even operable - and now, some of the sprinklers are spraying hard water directly onto the brand new back bedroom windows. The fencing was constructed, but there was a four month gap until the gates were working. There was a good amount of cutting corners, here - I could go on but I'm sure you get the gist. 

Sierra began working on the yard in November of 2018. It is now May of 2019 and per my dad, it is about 90% complete. As I am writing this on my parents' behalf, they have stated that they likely would not recommend Sierra to others. I may modify the review if they come and complete the work (it has been two weeks since we've last seen them), but for now, three stars it is.",2019-05-18 19:04:27

Such was our experience here when we had a ""team"" of four waitstaff (gender neutral might I point out) belaboring about our table. For the record that was a ""one-to-one"" relationship of service staff to patron which proved to be overwhelming.
It might have gone better. No wait. It WOULD have gone better had they been orchestrated better and had specific assignments. Maybe in reality they did, but it sure didn't seem like it. No sooner had we told one that ""no we don't need anything else"" when the next one would turn up and ask ""is there anything else we can get for you?"".
Don't get me wrong, I'm very well seasoned with experiencing professional wait service but this was out of hand.
I loved the more common attention to detail, like the dark cloth napkins set upon dark clothing and white cloth napkins set upon lighter clothing and the refilling of beverages and the removal of unwarranted service items like the extra fork or spoon you didn't need but the hovering was mind blowing. Each of the four in our party expressed the same frustration with our almost constant interruption of or private conversation.

An awesome indoor climbing experience for all. My boys have climbed here but it's my youngest who likes it the most. 
They have 3 systems where you don't need a spotter, the other climbs require a partner on the ground while you climb the walls. 
I've never climbed as I'm always the only adult with my boys but it's usually 50/50 split between adults and beginners climbing, all abilities. No need to be bashful of you're a beginner here. Laid back atmosphere. They give you a brief tutorial after they get you in the harness each time you come. They also offer lessons and other group and instructor led activities. There is also an opportunity to join and become a member/frequent climber that has perks, see their website for info. 
For my 9yo it was $12/day pass that included his climbing gear and shoes only slightly more for older kids. 
This is a great place. We've been 2x this week already and have been in the past as well. Great place to support.

So imagine my surprise when I come on here and see a black woman commenting as the ""business owner."" This is not okay and is false advertising. You are intentionally misleading people as part of a marketing plan. I initially came to the page to recommend to someone as a late night spot. The food is mediocre at best and certainly not ""authentic soul food"" but after a late night and drinks it gets the job done. Especially in an area where the old faithful Genes Poboys is gone and there are limited food options. However, after seeing this, I am truly appalled and cannot in good faith recommend anyone to patron this establishment. DO NOT EAT HERE.",2021-11-08 08:49:30
fOgIfRsVlT1Rk9cWGXrTYg,4,"I really loved living at the Raleigh building on 13th and Pennsylvania. It is an older building, but it has been renovated beautifully. From the stainless steel appliances, to the granite countertops, and the huge bay windows; the Raleigh is hands down the nicest apartment I have lived in. 

The location is convenient as well. It's on the north side of downtown, so you have to walk or drive a mile or so to get to most of the downtown attractions, but it was also nice to be a little bit away from all of the noise and traffic that comes with living downtown. We moved out after a year, due to our rent increasing almost $100 a month, which is the only bad thing I have to say about Circle City Apartments. We would've stayed if we could've afforded to, but it was already at the top of our rent budget when we moved in, so it just made sense for us to move to a more affordable place outside of downtown. However, the rent is actually very reasonable for those that can afford to pay premium prices to live downtown, and priced much better than some of the newer, luxury apartments downtown.

Overall, we had a positive experience renting from Circle City Apartments and I would absolutely recommend them to a friend looking to rent in downtown Indy.",2018-01-30 23:13:18

NXnWmsyvBx8hjmCTFROt2Q,5,"Extremely excited that this location opened up, considering the one at the Tucson Mall had closed and I didn't know what I was going to do with myself (I've had a Red Robin craving since I realized the other location was closing). 

First, I enjoy the bottomless fries. It isn't a healthy option and we should all limit how many fries we consume. Yeah whatever, when I go, I'm excited that the fries just keep coming. There are steak fries, chips, garlic fries, sweet potato fries. Great set of option here. 

I appreciate that when I asked for well-done, my burger was indeed well-done. That was pretty good, considering a lot of places don't understand my desire for ""no pink."" I got the Whiskey River BBQ without mayo (public service announcement: mayo is gross) and loved it. Delicious! The buns are to die for. They really impressed me. 

Also at the table was a Prime Chophouse that looked appetizing. Glancing over the menu, there are several different burgers that I'd love to try. I mean... there is a Bonzai burger (Hawaiian theme?) and the Blue Cheese burger, both of which look like they're amazing (I saw a Blue burger at a nearby table and salivated a little). 

Great service, even though they'd just opened and the place was slammed. They have TVs for football if you're into that. I think it makes the place too loud, and it is hard to have a quiet (well...any) conversation. But if you're there for food and not an intimate date you'll enjoy the burgers.",2018-09-12 20:19:43

6C8Ne6yRu6TzBLbhfhdduw,3,"tl;dr despite its gorgeous location and well-executed set-up, expect a menu of overpriced and underwhelming cafe fare

This all-day cafe, run by Top Chef champion Nick Elmi, was one of the hottest openings of the year. The Landing Kitchen is built into the ground floor of the Bala Cynwyd Residence Inn, itself an homage to the Pencoyd Ironworks foundry. Industrial accents including exposed beams, garage-doors style windows, and converted metalwork highlight the atmosphere. The spacious patio hosts plenty of marble tables, complete with umbrellas and heat lamps to accommodate any weather. If you're lucky, you can grab a seat at one of the sophisticated lawn chairs, arranged around the large gas firepit. The riverside location offers uncharacteristically stunning snapshots of the Schuylkill (one-upped only by the views from the Pencoyd footbridge, only a stone's throw away). Order at the counter, then take a number to your table.

We arrived mid-morning for Sunday brunch to a moderately sized line. Despite the hordes of staff members, most seemed either distracted or clueless. The line nearly stretched out the door by the time we ordered.

My partner and I split The Ironworker and the Landing Breakfast Sandwich. Both sandos were moderately sized, and both would have immensely benefited from a more exciting bun. For the former, the richness of the pork roll and Cooper sharp pleasantly contrasted the sweet tomato spread; however, the potato roll felt flimsy. For the latter, the maple sausage / salsa verde combo sported a nice zing of flavor, but the shoe-like English muffin was dull and forgettable. The table also shared an order of BBQ Fries, which could not have a more misleading name -- they were limp steakhouse fries, unevenly seasoned and served with Heinz ketchup packets. The coffees ranged from standard to underwhelming; flavor shots in the iced coffees were decidedly flavorless, despite an associated upcharge.

The bill sat at nearly $20 a head (after tax and tip). While the sandwiches were a step above fast-food breakfast sandos, the premium on them feels borderline criminal. While the Landing Kitchen is worth a visit at least once to appreciate the scenery, don't hold your breath for a dining experience to match.",2021-10-18 16:17:32
jc8xUrNwZRgXMSLr_qzAcA,5,"FINALLY Nashville gets a real Korean BBQ place. Well, Brentwood but close enough...and I didn't actually try the BBQ yet but it looks legit. The tables with grills are on the right side of the restaurant. If you just want the regular menu, you sit to the left. I went for lunch and was in the mood for some soup. Korean soup (or jjigae) is the best soup you will ever have. I used to live in Korea and would eat it almost every day when the weather was cold. Or hot. Or the next morning after a rough night. Ok, so it's always good (wiping off drool and getting back to my review). Sitting in the booth, it was pointed out to me that the table had a call button. This is what every restaurant in Korea has. If you need something, press the button. It might seem rude but it's actually pretty convenient. The menu has a mix of Japanese and Korean items. I didn't pay much attention to the sushi and focused on the Korean dishes. I was excited to see some great ""appetizers"" like tteokboki and pajeon. I knew I couldn't eat these plus a soup for lunch but I really want to go back for dinner and get some tteokboki. I knew right away what I wanted. Yukgaejang is my favorite Korean food. It's a spicy broth with shredded beef, egg, bean sprouts, glass noodles, and bracken (? I think this is the translation in English). If you've never had this, order it. It's life changing. I have had this at other  Korean restaurants in America and it has been a bit oily or just way too spicy (which it's supposed to be so that's fine). However, this one was perfect. It was spicy enough without killing me, it wasn't oily, and it had just the right amount of all the ingredients. This is the best bowl of yukgaejang I have had since coming back from Korea. The ban chan were also delicious and plentiful. My favorite dish is the cucumbers with the gochujang. Since it was lunch, I just had a Coke, but they have great prices on beer. They also have soju if you want to drink like a true Korean. Overall, this place is pretty authentic and seems to have all of my Korean favorites. I will be able to come here and fulfill all of my Korean cravings!",2018-10-16 18:47:26

This cocktail was made with a st Elmo whiskey which had hints of cherry in it. They were so good!!! Great dishes to try if you love seafood like I do is the scallops with couscous. My fiancé had the filet which was super tender. For sides we had fried green tomatoes, creamed spinach, and mash potatoes. Everything was great even the service. Our server Sarah was very attentive.

__lBqInsieAkCXmrPSMguA,3,"Come here early if you want to be able to pick from the entire menu! I think I would have had a much better experience if I'd been able to have my first or second choice meal. The Mug is farm to table, which means that their ingredients come in limited quantities so once they run out, they're out! Head over early to ensure that you can have your pick of everything they have to offer. 

I had the sloppy joe because they were completely out of chicken when I went. The meat was what you'd expect from a sloppy joe but the bun was just a general grocery store bun. I decided to go for the garlic fries, but found them to be a huge letdown. Instead of the fries being tossed with fresh garlic or granulated garlic and any other seasonings, they just added chopped garlic to the top of regular, non-seasoned fries. I've heard the sweet potato fries are good, so maybe go with those instead. We wanted to try their mac and cheese, but they were also out of that when we went. On the plus side, their root beer is delicious! Someone in my party said the pork tenderloin was very tasty, so go for it if you're interested.

They have a nice covered patio and allow pets to sit there while you eat, so that's a huge plus especially when the weather is nice. Overall, just make sure to head over early if you want to be able to choose from the entire menu!",2019-09-29 02:32:42

tHVFAI0kemjV8Il9UjXBrw,4,"I go to Hung Vuong at least once a week for most Asian groceries. The prices just can't be beaten here. Seriously. Plus, Hung Vuong is a lot bigger than Hmart (the other nearby Asian grocery store), so they consistently carry the most exotic produce and imported shelf items in this area.

Although if you see something you like, stock up because there's no guarantee it will ever be back in stock again. This has happened to me with some of my favorite items in the past (a certain brand of Thai coconut milk and a brand of Filipino cookies).

However, you should be aware of one thing with Hung Vuong's low prices. Some produce could be on the verge of going bad or shelf items slightly past the expiration date. Not everything is like that, but sometimes there are many more than I would expect. So, inspect your fruits and check your dates on items you buy to be on the safe side.

TIP: Be sure to sign up for their rewards program, available at the customer service area. That way, you can get a few bucks off once you spend a certain amount.",2022-01-10 02:22:07
s6CB8sohXlCL6XZDgAy3SA,1,"I think Basic 4 was one of the most disappointing veg restaurant experiences I've ever had. I ordered the ""Carrot Tuna"", which a previous user raved about on another site, VegGuide.org. That user only had one review so I can't help but wonder if he/she is an employee/owner of Basic 4 and posted this false review to boost business.

I've had tofu, seitan, and chickpea-based ""tuna"" and they've all been good. Some use dulse/seaweed to give it a ""fishy"" taste, some use chopped celery to give it better texture, and all use some sort of vegan mayo. Basic 4's ""carrot tuna"" uses none and they don't add anything else to give it interesting flavor or texture. The sandwich was literally carrots on a pita. The pate appeared to be pure carrots pulverized in a food processor, with a little onion and maybe salt and lemon juice. How on earth is this supposed to resemble tuna? The plain carrot mixture was scooped into a pita bread with lettuce, onions, and tomatoes - no protein, and no mayo or sauce. It was the most boring sandwich I've ever had and a total waste of $6. I couldn't bring myself to finish it, so I took half of it home, added a veggie burger, some Veganaise and Siracha, and called it a day.

I also ordered the cream of broccoli soup for about $5, which turned out to be very bland. I'm glad they offered a vegan cream soup, as much of their menu isn't vegan (it looks like some of the soy meats they use contain milk), but it tasted like the stereotypical vegan soup that you would NOT want your non-vegan friends to taste. There was no robust flavor so instead of using rich vegetable broth, soy cream, and vegan butter, I think they just used water and thickened it with flour. No good.",2011-12-10 18:53:18

I enjoy the South Philly location a LITTLE more because each time I have been there - it's been way less crowded than the location on Sansom ever has been (Sansom location gets a LOT of traffic).  

The pizza at slice is really very good.  The crust is thin - the cheese is great - and there is NO grease.  I mean NONE.  Which I can seriously appreciate.  Additionally, they have a variety of cheese and dough options - which is great for people who are vegan, lactose intolerant, or are watching their weight.  The sauces taste good, and they always have an interesting combo of toppings / variety of pizza's that are great.  

The ambiance is simple, the service is good - the people are really friendly, but beware - they take only cash.  

The major DOWNSIDE of Slice is that it is a tad bit expensive. However, it's worth it.

Of course, ALL of the BBQ items are top notch. Blue Oak, in my opinion, is the city's best BBQ joint. They've mastered the rub, sauces, and most importantly, smoking and cooking techniques. Fantastic bark on the brisket, perfect texture and flavor on the ribs, and just the right tang in the sauces. 

Outside of the ribs and brisket, my favorite item has to be the smoked chicken wings... they are FANTASTIC and without a doubt, some of the best around. Blue Oak perfectly crisps and then smokes the wings, adding a light buffalo sauce at the end. 

Flight of beers....... also good. Why get one beer, when you can get 5 small beers?

If the comparison is any other place in Santa Barbara- it's safe to say you won't be disappointed. The dining experience at Carusos truly is a Michelin worthy experience and one that should be indulged in for a very special occasion. 

I was invited to dinner at Carusos October 2021. At this time the restaurant was doing dinner service with a prefix menu. There was an an Amuse Bouche, a starter, a main plate, and of course dessert for $180 per person. Well the price tag may seem stark, a seasoned fine dinner enthusiast will quickly understand the caliber of experience is well worth it, and the novice can't deny that nothing beats the view of the sun setting over Miramar Beach as you're having dinner. 

Although both our Cacio e Pepe and Steak were perfectly prepared, I was interested Chef Massimo Falsini's more creative dishes! Some unique touches like fresh chimichurri sauce on the steak a surprise, and genuinely made the dish go from perfect (boring but good) to memorable. The most pleasing thing for me was the the grilled octopus as a starter with a base of  mole ( I believe?) sauce. The Octopus was chard on the outside with a slight crisp and soft and tender in the inside. Sweet and savory sauce underneath was a perfect compliment, and it's rustic flavor lingered on the palate. The dish is clearly inspired by Latin flavor and did well to pay homage to our cultural heritage in SB. Highly recommend this and hope the chef continues to keep us feeling a sense of discovery in his food over the usual aim of classism and consistency. If he keep up the creativity I could see Caruso's becoming a place I revisit again and again. 

As a wine enthusiast, I naturally brought wine from my own stash; my favorite Napa Valley table wine Overture by Opus One. The wine was juicy and velvety with enough structure to pair with the steak but not to overpowering for the octopus. . That being said there was a sommelier available.

The cocktail we each started with was was a great idea! Believe it or not, I'd took the mock tail which was inspired by Earl Grey tea and absolutely delicious. I would definitely order this again. My date ordered a dirty martini, and it was standard- just how we wanted it! 

All in all, everything was delicious but what really left an impression was the flavor of the food accompanied by that dreamy pink and purple sunset over the water. I highly recommend booking a table outside on the patio for sunset.",2021-12-17 05:13:57
YrlNGnrofZHseVYxrLrvJA,3,"We were gifted lunch coupons from Yelp to eat at any of the kiosks during the food court's grand re-opening. After the speech by Poppy Tooker and a ribbon cutting ceremony, we ambled around to check out the choices. I went with the Soul food offering, although I can't remember the name of the place and they're not listed as a tenant on Place St. Charles' website, so they need to update that. I do remember they had hot trays with stewed chicken thighs, a beef entree, fried fish and chicken tenders; pick your protein and add 2 sides and a drink. I asked what the fish was and she said tilapia, which I won't eat, as it's farmed raised, unsustainably produced fish from Asia, and I told her so. She said they had catfish and they would make me some, which was a nice offer, but my partner had already ordered  from another restaurant and I didn't want to wait, so I had the fried chicken fingers. The chicken was dry and over cooked, and the sides were not seasoned well, so I'd skip this place if I ate at the food court again. My partner fared better with the Middle Eastern food, but nothing we ate here was typical New Orleans quality restaurant food; just really average. The location is great for office workers, and there are a lot of choices at the food court; now they need to make better food.",2019-08-05 13:51:32
JfamyW3gf7xK1M_-5NZabw,5,"First of all, I'm ashamed that this is only my second visit ever.  Second of all, my top five best burger joints in Indiana. For the quality, they sure bring the food out pretty quick. Also, the burgers are not perfectly shaped discs. (Which is a pet peeve of mine). By default, they are cooked medium well, which, I believe, should be the standard. The patties themselves are decadent, tender, flavorful and charred to perfection.  Bubba's has officially raised the bar for ""$10 burgers"".  
     So the food is outstanding but the service matches it as well. Our server was attentive but not hovering.  My beer was cold and my food was hot and my service came with a smile.  And I love all the TV's!  Why would this place get anything lower than 5 stars??!!! C'mon! This place is heavenly!!",2018-12-22 00:31:23
V_feMM9_OQmqOJNz8oSlVg,2,"Stopped in for dinner with a group on a Friday. The restaurant is gorgeous, harkening back to the old days of getting dressed up to go to dinner (though the dress code has undoubtedly relaxed since the place opened).

We chatted with the sommelier, who was knowledgeable and helpful. We enjoyed a few great bottles of wine, the highlight of our evening. Our server, Jarrod, was also fun, bantering with us during our meal. 

We had a couple of appetizers -- the escargot and a seafood smorgasbord that included bbq shrimp and oysters. What was odd here was that the plating included the escargot on the plate with other items despite being ordered separately. This isn't a huge deal, but also made the appetizers less appetizing to one in our group who is not a fan of escargot. It was also odd in light of the bbq shrimp already being plated separately. 

I enjoyed the vichyssoise, and others had and enjoyed the caprese salad. The entrees, however, were truly disappointing. A few of us partook in the coolinary menu. The filets lacked salt. It was absolutely bland and disappointing. Nothing in the dish truly popped in terms of flavor. My husband had the fish which did have a tasty sauce but wasn't quite a home run. Another in our party ordered an a la carte fish entree and stopped eating after a couple of bites. It was clearly and tangibly an off night for the kitchen. 

Two other things were exceptionally frustrating. First, when a back dining room emptied out, someone was in there vacuuming while the door to the room closest to our table remained wide open. This lasted at least 25 minutes before the door was closed, but the person vacuuming must've been aiming for a Guinness record as they then vacuumed for over an hour. (The room isn't large enough to warrant that, but maybe that's how they earn employee of the month?)

Finally, the biggest upset was how restaurant employees actively avoided reminding patrons to wear their masks as they walked around. While I saw all employees wearing masks appropriately, it felt like a slap in the face to see them engage and banter with customers who were walking around the dining room without a mask. The restaurant needs to adhere strictly to state and local guidance which demands masks be worn inside. I understand that many employees may be tired of arguing with guests over this, but the safety of all trumps any semblance of discomfort for them. 

All in all, an off night. I expected a lot more from an iconic restaurant like Dickie Brennan's, but they absolutely missed the mark. I am disappointed, and certainly recommend going elsewhere, especially for a true quality upscale dining experience.",2021-08-07 16:01:30
RKPkxOYQlM0BjhM-H6_vAw,4,"This is like the capital grille of seafood establishments.   Very good for the crowd who enjoy good food with fancy digs but does not reach foodie level.  

A few notes: 
- you have to crash through all the plebes on bourbon street to get to the establishment
- the maître'd and servers are very pleasant if not terribly sophisticated
- food is plopped down on the table without explanation.  
- very much a steakhouse vibe though of course the focus is on fish selection.  This is evidenced by the branding on the plates and large font menus ;)
- daily menu so changes with whatever is fresh 
- flexible preparations.  You can have the fish cooked to your liking and can mix the sides if you're not feeling rice for instance (ie good for paleo heads)
- lively environment on the loud side
- can go healthy or full on decadent depending on your pleasure 

I hope that's helpful!   New Orleans has a plethora of great restaurants and gw fins fits the bill if not quite the most forward thinking of the crowd (not necessarily a bad thing).   If you wear raw denim opt for peche, if you are wearing a suit and comfortably large trousers go to gw fins",2014-10-17 00:43:09

And at Trader Joes you can always find samples.  The lady who normally works the sample area at this location is awesome (I cant remember her name)!  She gives lots of great ideas.  I have found that they have their cheeses open in the back so if you want to try what something tastes like ask the sample lady and if you are nice she will make it happen.
The sushi here is not bad considering it is pre packaged.  I find the Lobster Roll to be the best kind here.  The Lobster Bisque is pretty yummy as well.  The wine selection is nice however I am not a huge drinker so I can't talk much about that. I am in love with their orange chicken.  It is so simple to make and tastes very good!

The good:  the service was awesome.  Prompt, pleasant, speedy. The hatch mayo was delicious.  I didn't want to stop eating it with the fries.  
The mediocre:  the burger was ok but kind of small and dry for the price.  My friend and I shared a burger thinking they'd be a good size and fill us up.  These are not good for sharing.  
The bad:  the fries were either over crisp or soggy...how the heck does that happen!!  The reason I continued eating them was due to the hatch mayo.

LQJ7jEWxBBLYiaGVWdN5Dg,4,"Renown South Meadows Medical Center is the last place I ever really want to be.   Sadly, I'm there often - to the ER, to the surgery center and even a few times to visit people admitted to the hospital. 

All-in-all a nice clean hospital.  Friendly staff.  Tons of parking.  A security systems that still makes me scratch a my head.  I'm used to showing my id and getting a colored hall pass to gain access to a certain area of a hospital.  Here you just read the reader boards and head to where you want to be.   

My most recent visit to the Renown was to the surgery center.   Everyone was very nice save one RN - not worth the details but if you can't be nice dealing with people going in for surgery perhaps you need a sick day!   

I'm still not sure why we were told to arrive @530am for a 9am surgery.   Yes she was taken in early but we could've arrive at 630am and still spent an 1 1/2 hours in the waiting room. 

The procedure was over quickly.  Kudos to the staff for helping me get mom in the car.  After the discharge paperwork was done.  They told me to get my car and meet them at the ER entrance.  I was allowed to park right in front and they wheeled her to the car and helped get her settled.

My friend and I decided to split the Marcos combo deal. It comes with 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert, and 2 more entrees to take home! It was only about $45. It was such a great deal I couldn't pass it up! 

We ordered the mozzarella squares as our app. It comes with four huge squares of fried mozz. I wished there was a bit more sauce but other than that it was very good. I could only eat one square before starting to get full. 

For my entree, I ordered the four cheese ravioli. I honestly was not blown away by it. It was not bad, but was not as good as I was expecting. It could have definitely used some more red sauce. 

I became full quickly and it was time to order dessert. We decided on the brownie and I'm glad we did! It was huge, warm, and so tasty. 

At the end of the day, I went home with enough left overs to feed a small village. Overall, I had a nice experience at Maggiano's. It was not as high quality food as I expected, as it reminded me of a better version of Olive Garden.

Been here more than a few times- with or without an appointment and staff are friendly and accommodating. I have been to quite a few places but for me - this is the one. They are busy but still take their time with each customer and are meticulous. I usually try to go to Leo who has been there for more than 10 years - but I have had no issues with anyone else either. If you like one person and want to keep consistency- I'd book them in advance. There's no time I have found which is not busy so expect to wait if you don't have an appoint. If your waiting and wish to come back there's fast food and coffee in the same complex and your 5 min away from South Common. I have schellac and it has lasted me for some time - reasonable priced they offer other services like waxing. There's a small sitting area in the front and one communal bathroom in the back. Fairly clean. They don't accept credit so make sure you either have cash or debit on hand. They do have an atm machine inside their salon just in case you forget. If you do have an issue with your nails - I have seen them try to accommodate corrections. They have tv screens everywhere but they do chat and are very friendly.

V-jiTqYCFl0Tdxg8cmx1NQ,5,"I have updated my review based upon my final results. I found this place on Groupon, and I searched their social media posts and explored their website plenty of times before deciding to give them a try. I was interested in getting my lips touched up, in order to achieve symmetric fullness but in an attempt to avoid the fake, deflated tire look. Previously, I had damaged nerve on the lower corner of my lips, and I mainly seek to have the side with the damaged nerve look symmetric to the normal side.

Their base prices are probably some of the better prices I've seen in the area. The doctor does the fillers himself, although he does apparently have one PA that does some of the fillers too.

I was fortunate that they were able to get me an appointment on the day I called. When I was brought into the room, my lips were numbed before I even spoke to the doctor. When the doctor came in with the syringe, he briefly asked what kind of look I was going for and started right away.

I understand that it wasn't my first time getting this done, but it was my second, and I'm new to this place and by no means a pro. He was already injecting by the time I had the chance to ask, ""What's in the syringe?"" since the deal said ""Juvederm ultra or ultra plus."" I thought the ""or"" implied I'd get a choice. There was some bruising, which is normal.

I think it's nice, however, that he saved a little bit in the syringe so that when the swelling goes down, if there's anything that needs to be fixed, I don't have to buy a whole new syringe just to touch up a small area.

While I wasn't blown away by my experience here, I am thrilled with the results that I received. I would definitely trust my lips again with Dr. Pinto.",2019-04-02 15:10:59

kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA,4,"My friend and I made last minute plans to go to Cuba Libre for happy hour on a weeknight. Honestly, I wasn't planning to make a full meal out of our happy hour outing, but that completely changed after glancing around at the dishes our neighbors at the bar were getting. Everything looked so delicious!

First off, you are required to sit at the bar if you plan to order off of their happy hour menu. Ideally, we would have loved to sit at a table, but the bar ended up being just fine. The bartender was nice and friendly, although the service was pretty slow (more on that later).

We first started off with a glass of red sangria which might have been some of the best sangria I've ever had. It was very fruity and sweet but definitely packed a punch. My original plan was to call it a night after just one drink, but it was so good that I ended up getting a second. My friend got a white sangria for her second round and said the red was far better than the white.

As for food, we indulged in a variety of different small plates including Shrimp Cóctel, Pineapple Guacamole Cubano, a Churrasco Slider, Chicken Croquetas, and a few empanadas. All were really great but my personal favorites were the empanadas and the guacamole! The pulled pork empanada that I had was extremely flavorful, fried to perfection, and served with some kind of dipping sauce that I loved. It was quite filling as well! The guacamole was fresh and had chunks of pineapple which offered a sweet taste to this normally savory dish. They were served with plantain chips which I really enjoyed. The plantain chips weren't nearly as crisp as a tortilla chip would be, but I really liked them nonetheless. The presentation was also superb. 

The small plates are only $5 during happy hour which is an awesome deal. If you want to try a bunch of different things, I would encourage you to get the sampler. The sampler allows you to choose any seven small plates for just $31. That's what we did and it was a really good decision. I left completely stuffed and I was able to make this my dinner for the night!

As for the service, although it started off well, it was on a downward slope as the night went on. As happy hour came to a close, the bartenders became less attentive and we had to flag someone down numerous times for water refills and our check. Our corner of the bar was filled with dirty plates and our first round of empty drinks.

Still, I was very content with my overall happy hour experience. In fact, my friend and I have already talked about returning! The specials were great, the food and drinks were solid, and the prices were very reasonable. Hopefully everything stays up to par next time and maybe there will even be some improvement in service!",2018-10-03 02:49:09

When i told someone about where i got my car they told me i better be ready for b*ll*it and headaches and he was ever so right ! 

Service department is just the worst there is no head on the donkey its just roaming wild ; ive gotten better customer service at the tanque verde swapmeet on a rainy day by a man who doesnt speak english . 

I told the ""service department manager"" that the only thing going smooth since we have purchased this VW is that the payments are being taken every month!! Ive had parts replaced , needed to be ordered , back ordered on a 2021 atlas . 

Some would like to say ' did i take covid into consideration'? But thats a pretty easy way out if you ask me . 

With all our problems and headaches we were given a one time car payment on VW which was just a slap in the face . If you read this please do not get a car from this dealership drive a few miles and go to the auto mall .

The table that we sat at was socially distanced and all the staff wore masks. *Note: The bar wasn't open seating, you have to get on a waiting list and there's no social distancing in the bar area. There was music playing in the restaurant but it wasn't too loud so you were still able to talk to the people at your table. I loved the decor and the booth was comfortable. 

THE FOOD...it was amazing!!!! The braised chicken burrito came out and the portion size was a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. It full of flavor and they were generous with the ingredients inside it the burrito and the queso on top. The rice was cooked to perfection and the pico tasted really fresh. I was beyond pleased with the meal. 

DRINKS: I ordered a Jalapeño and pineapple margarita and when I went to get my ID, I realized I left it at home (insert sad face). So unfortunately I was unable to get a drink this time. The waitress did see if the manager would accept a picture of my passport. It wasn't a big deal that they couldn't  and I thanked her for asking. I will be sure to have my ID the next time. 

Overall I had a good experience and their prices were reasonable. I only live about 1 mile away so I will definitely be back to try more items on their menu.",2021-03-22 07:16:55

r9aZO4aqCeINt8Yjq-JksA,5,"This is amazing Cajun food. It was like I was back in New Orleans. This is the best Cajun food that you can get in the greater Nashville area. Everything is fresh and authentic. Their dirty rice, étouffée, red beans and gumbo are served fresh not just scooped out from a huge vat. The food is full of rich flavor and is delicious! They also have Cafe du Monde coffee which is a New Orleans staple. 

The only downside is that the service is not the best, the restaurant is a quick serve so you order your food and drinks at the register. The food is delivered to your table in no particular order and not necessarily all together. The servers just bring the food the fountain drinks are self serve. When you pay with a card you are prompted for the tip up front which is slightly annoying since the  servers provide such little actual service.",2021-12-12 20:53:40

I started with a ginger phosphate. If you like real ginger, this drink is a delight. The tartness, the real ginger flavor, and the sweetness were near perfect harmony. Move over iced tea, you've got competition now.

Next up: the Farm Burger. I only eat burgers a few times a year, so I went big. Local ham, egg, and bacon topping the beef patty made it great. The beef was high quality, the bun delightful. I think the beef might actually exceed the quality of Burger Up, especially for the price. I balanced the Farm Burger with some sweet potato fries. Around the table, plates were mostly cleaned.

Despite the large group, we had excellent service who handled the half international crowd and a few late additions to the group with grace and efficiency. It was a little comical though when an over 60 year old European got carded for his beer.",2014-12-07 01:33:32
UyrVSzM7iH1HSS-nCjWB2g,1,"In my lifetime, I have never given a bad review of any organization.  This just goes to show that there is always a first time.  A year ago on 1/11/2021 my mother died in this hospital as a result of negligence and wrongful death.
At the time of her death the senior staff were very apologetic but now they are totally ignoring us.  They first turned us over to their legal department and started a year long process of setting up discussion times and then ignored them.  Now they have hired outside council to continue ignoring us.
What amazes me is that this hospital professes it's Christian Caring Nature in everything that they do but the reality is that they do not.
Our story is not unique.  they've done it to other people in the past and they continue doing it to others.  We've heard their stories via our social and media efforts and our website which can be found at mercy hospital kills dot com.

 He had a very nice jazz band assembled there that evening And some of the people in the audience came up to sing from time to time. Adesso Is located or the second floor of a lovely old building on Walnut  Street. The club is very large with lotsa comfortable seating to enjoy a good cigar. However, The drinks are very expensive and the servers constantly hound you and ask you do you do you need a drink?

At this point, I must have tried 2 different burgers, 2 different sandwiches, and at least one wrap, if not two. All of them...eh. Not the worst thing I've ever eaten, but far from the best.

Speaking of breakfast or lunch, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  But my favorite is always the chef's choice -- Plato Poca Cosa.  A surprise selection of three entrees...usually anchored by a tamale + two random choices.  Rice, beans, chips, tortillas and salad come with, too.

The kati wrap was really well done, it didn't break and wasn't chewy or tough. They made the wrap right away, there was almost no waiting and it was really cheap! I hate paying a ton for fancy Indian food because most of the time the recipes come from regions where the people who cook the recipes live on very little income. The tastes in this wrap were comparable to some of the best Indian food I've tried. I think this is a chain, if it is I haven't tried any other locations. They have seating inside and outside. It is a quick service restaurant where the employees are always behind the counter and you pick the food up from the counter. There is a case of bottled and canned drinks. The white sauce is not a garlic sauce, it tastes more like ranch, it did not fit on my sandwich, so I didn't use it. Overall I'll definitely be back when I'm craving Indian!

Upon arrival, we were greeted and sat immediately. We started with a carafe of Peach Bellini, which was great. We ordered The Oreo French Toast, Apple Pie French toast and Pecan French toast, along with Shrimp and Grits. Now, I had to send the shrimp and grits back, because they weren't hot. They also only put five shrimp in the entire dish, and I expected a few more. After sending the shrimp and grits back, I decided to order the Red Velvet pancakes, which took a long time to come because they are made to order. By the time they came, my friends were already finished eating! The Red Velvet Pancakes were hot and huge, but definitely lacked flavor-- like it tasted like some plain batter, that's it! 

Let's get into the French Toast... The French toast was absolutely AMAZING!!! Each one we ordered was packed with flavor! The Oreo was my absolute favorite! It was made with Challah bread, and had Oreo stuffed inside. Talk about a foodgasim!!! If you come here, you MUST try the FRENCH TOAST! It's probably legit the best French toast I've had.

Had a great guide - Evangelina - and be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes.  The streets are bumpy, sidewalks uneven and tho I didn't count the blocks, seemed like a lot of walking - took 2 hours, altho we left after 1.5 hours because our host was waiting for us.

Tours are at 3 pm, 6 pm and 8 pm - we took the 8 pm on a Friday night.  The days and months you visit NOLA will affect the amount of people who will be on the streets in the French Quarter.

So You All Heard of The Famous Bourbon Street, Right? Mardi Gras central! Beads galore! Where it's legal to walk around outside with brewskis or your choice of poison, even double-fisting it! In my opinion, it's Las Vegas, San Diego, & DTLA all in one area. Party Central bar-hopping with a mix genre of music, both DJ's spinning and live bands performing. There were several strip clubs and a good number of fancy restaurant choices in the mix.

We had enough time to check out both areas during our first visit (we definitely plan on making another trip back). Bourbon Street was fun but Frenchmen Street was a BLAST!!

You get a giant bowl and it looks incredible. The mac and cheese part is good but the chili was too spicy for us and so we had to leave it behind.

TtuLyYy4Gf41XA2JUQgY8A,1,"I am appalled by the lack of professionalism at this place. Spend your 10k for a wedding elsewhere where people will actually value your money and will be nice to you. In the middle of planning our wedding, we got switched to a different coordinator who made it clear through email and in person that she did not want to deal with us. She treated us as if she did not want to deal with us because she did not make commission from our wedding. And let me say this, I am by no means a bridezilla. We're all human, all I ask is that if you mess up, you apologize for it and be nice to me if I am spending money at your establishment. 

  Planning my ""destination"" wedding started off great at the Grand Plaza. I was working with Kate and visited the property. She was warm, friendly and helpful. We even met with another coordinator who was friendly as well. 9 months before my wedding I got an email saying that Kate is no longer with the company and that Kristin would be taking care of us. I emailed Kristin early September to say that we would be in the area on the 13th to the 16th of this month and could we do our tasting. Due to our flights and the timing that they offer tastings, we could only squeeze in a 30 minute tasting. We had been emailing back and forth confirming the 16th. Kristin emailed me the menu selections on the 20th. Not once did she mention that she needed the tasting menu selections back within a certain time frame. I emailed her on the 12th with our menu selections to which she responded ""Unfortunately, we need a two week notice for a tasting. Is there any other time you can come in?""  I emailed her back reminding her that this was a destination wedding so there is no other time and that we had been discussing coming in on the 16th since the beginning of September and not once did she mention a deadline or follow up if she needed them back in a certain time. On the 13th I spoke with her and her response was very dry ""yeah I see what you mean."" Never apologized but said they were able to do the tasting. 
 That Saturday, October 14th when we had an actual meeting with Kristin and a tour of the property. Throughout the tour, Kristin was very condescending, unhelpful and unfriendly. When we asked questions, she responded as if our questions were stupid. She talked to us like we were children. She even rolled her eyes when I asked to see guest rooms. This was after I mentioned on the phone and when we first arrived that it was my fiancé's first time at the property so he wanted to see guest rooms. During the meeting, I brought up the fact that she spelled our names wrong in the email. She looked at the screen, looked at the file and then said ""yeah it's in here right,"" again looking at us like we were stupid. Again, never apologizing!  Today, I spoke with Gloria, the assistant manager, who offered to switch me to a different coordinator. She apologized and said they would handle it on their end but kept bringing up ""personalities not meshing."" Personalities have nothing to do with professionalism. After a lot of haggling, Gloria offered the additional $150 I left for the glamour room but refused to give me back the $500 deposit as if I want to plan an entire wedding again six months before my date!",2017-10-20 21:06:35

The tour guide/bartender gave us a view of the distillery and all the equipment that creates these liquors. Most of the canisters were made from copper. 

After that, we went to taste more drinks. We had probably about 10 mini shots of all the liquors they made. From whiskey, vodka, bourbon, gin, to sweet dessert drinks. Then we went to the gift store after the tour concluded.

I just couldn't imagine what the hype was about, but it became a personal quest to get reservations one day while visiting Philly. 

Then came COVID... I was with my Uber-picky, seven-year-old god-daughter and her vegetarian father and they had outdoor seating available for four. So we were finally gonna check out Vedge!

Y'all I am reformed!!! This was the most amazing meal I've had in a LONG time and that's saying a LOT!! They have an abbreviated menu with only 4 appetizers and 4 entrees available, so we ordered one of everything to share amongst the table. My God-daughter tried and loved almost everything!!

If I had to rank the courses it would go something like this:
#1. Rutabaga Fondue - I am a cheese lover and I didn't even miss the cheese! And that pretzel roll.... Good lawdy!!! 

#2 Chocolate cookie and key lime ice cream. Both were to die for!!! Still with no dairy!!!

#3 Dirt List Salad

#4 Avocado stuffed with deviled hearts of palm, heirloom tomatoes, green gazpacho vinaigrette and black salt - the stuffing was very dill forward but still yummy

#5 Smoked Portobello Carpaccio with caper vinaigrette and  nicoise potato salad -this was delish!!

#6 Charred Broccoli with spicy sesame noodles, smoky trumpet mushrooms and shaved cucumber salad. *contains gluten and sesame - loved this one too!! Perfect 

#7 Gochujang Glazed Tofu with edamame cream, nori and charred corn salad - tofu wasn't very firm but had a great char

#8 Bourbon Poached Peaches over decadent chocolate  was very rich and delicious!!

#9 Gold Bar Squash with chermoula, warm red lentils and a tomato olive salad - very Mediterranean

#10 Maitake Mushroom with smoked Chile glaze, black bean corn masa, whipped avocado and vegetable escabeche - my least favorite of the night

I purchased a very expensive dining room table, I was totally in love with it. I got home, everything was set up and looked beautiful, however the glass insert was chipped, they replaced that with a new one. Okay, moving forward, a month later the table's finish started to peel. A peeling finish was upsetting for sure, however I reached out to Bliss Home's customer service and was in contact with Nina.
Well, she promised me that the table would be repaired by their repairperson, we have been having problems with this table since June 2021, and I have only had it 3 weeks.
What they don't understand is when you pay for something NEW, you don't expect to get a REPAIRED item!!!!!!
I asked for them to please just replace my table with the table that they took the broken glass insert from, but that idea was ignored.
They would rather repair first, it should be that they make the customers' desire more important than theirs.
I will not recommend them to anyone and I will never purchase from them again, which is really sad because they have my perfect bedroom furniture in the store.",2022-01-18 18:38:30
tfrXLkZXppgIynFDicSIAg,1,"Just had breatfast there with my sister.    Service was terrible.   Don't know if he  was new or not but service was bad.    When we finally got our food it was warm.    The help needs to learn if your coming around with the coffee to bring both pots.  I had to ask for every cup I wanted while I'm waiting for my food which took over a half hour after putting in our order. There is another Denny's in the area so maybe I should try them.
  Maybe better mangement who cares would be better.  

My daughter had the same experience at the same restruant not too long ago her and a friend.     Even after talking to the manager the service has not improved.    What's Wrong.??????  Why hasn't it been corrected????

LQJ7jEWxBBLYiaGVWdN5Dg,4,"The sad fact is I first went to Nu Yawk Pizza when it opened in the 70s in a random strip mall.  My grandmother was thrilled that there was something close to NY pizza in Reno.  

The pizza is good.  The crust is crunchy and doughy at the same time.   My pizza was wet -- perhaps I needed to let it set but I was starving.  The topping were fresh mushrooms (I kinda miss the canned 'shrooms) and red onions.  I can't complain too much as I ate 3 slices - it was breakfast/lunch.  

I had time to kill so I ordered 3 shots of espresso over ice.  They gave me 4 shots -- BONUS right?!?!  But they gave me two coffee cups each with two shots.   Then they gave me a paper cup to pour all the shots in.  Shortbreads with powdered sugar is not top of mind when I think of dessert at a NY pizza joint -- it wasn't as buttery as I hoped.  

They have outdoor seating and they tend to broadcast the NY games.",2017-02-07 04:37:55
DTnJak1IlFKZtYHh8dZFIQ,3,"Had a pretty great time with my whole family as we celebrated my brothers birthday!

Made reservations and were seated pretty quickly. Waitress seemed a little distracted a few times which lead to a wrong dinner being ordered which was an ok substitution, but ended up costing about $7 more AND didn't get end of dinner tea! But she somewhat made it ok by getting us all (even though it came with some meals) complimentary ice cream. 

Each of our dinners were pretty good. Tuna special was REally good and cooked just right. The Ocean Treasure was great due to I was craving it... but other than that, it was just lobster, shrimp, and scallops... not all that special. A taste of the Teriyaki steak was good but glad it wasn't my meal because that flavor could become too much too quick! Taste of the Hibachi steak = New York strip AND the 'other' dinner which had filet mignon with shrimp was good, just nothing extraordinary.

The soup was good, the salad was good though it could have used a little less of the ginger dressing. Like the fried rice a lot! Very tasty! And the sides/appetizers of shrimp, zucchini, and onions was also pretty good! Also had the spider roll (sushi) which was really tasty, but should have been a little longer - couple more pieces.

But above all, what you are going for is the show! And as always, it is always fun!! Our chef had only been there a couple weeks, so his talent may not have been as refined as others... but is also wasn't as rehearsed as others! Had fun with him and enjoyed the show!

Overall it is a great place for an occasion... also fun place to take the kids!",2011-10-19 00:19:14
BJNxQGG3dx5uLxINGA5kDg,4,"I haven't had steak in a long time and I had some business in South Tampa so I   was pondering Terra Gaucha. I have pretty much stopped going to buffets since I have lost a lot of weight in the last few years, but I 
haven't been to a South American steakhouse in 7-8 yrs (Texas De Brazil)

Note: If you've not done so join their email club, they will email you a $15 dollar coupon. I did this and was able to use it today.

Let the tempting of the Uric Acid Gods begin!

TGBS is in a plaza which is attached to Salon Loft and a Credit Union. It is adjacent to Wright's Gourmet House. Thankfully, there is adequate parking in a lot.

The interior is very classy with mostly a light gray motif. The salad bar is in the center  of the dining area. Many waiters are scurrying about attending to guests with gray outfits and the gauchos are clad in red shirts and are brandishing skewers. Depending on the time of day, you can just get the salad bar or just the meats I went with the full dining experience at $45.

I ordered a Caiprinha. It is a Brazilian staple alcoholic drink with lime,sugar ,and cachaca (spirit from fermented sugarcane IIRC) In a superficial sense, it taste similar to mojito, but more robust. It was very strong ($10).  4.5/5

The Salad Bar was very elaborate and had more non veg items than veg from hat I could see. It included cheese, prosciutto, salami, french bread, salad, bacon, roasted peppers, a mushroom dish I can't spell. While it was the most varied salad bars I've seen, I didn't sample everything to due to being more excited for the meats. I didn't see Lobster Bisque there like Annah P said Darn.

Many South American Steakhouses use a system where you place a disk with green side up to indicate to the gauchos that you want meat. Red side up means you don't want meat served. They have many cuts of different meat including steak, chicken, pork , salmon.  

What I prefer about the SAS is that imo they season the meat better than American ones. Some people have mentioned that  meat is too salty at these types of restaurants, but I did not feel that here at TGBS.  I tried picanha, sirloin, rib, chicken , and sausages. They even have proteins you can request. A couple ahead of me got a grilled shrimp skewer. Neat.

In addition to the meat, other servers bring mashed potatoes, sweet plaintains, grilled pineapple slices, and cassava cheese bread. 

 Picanha and sirloin were soft , juicy, and packed with flavor.  5/5
Everything  else was generally  4/5.
The Cassava Cheese bread was serviceable. It's a nice idea and its different but the taste was just ok. To be honest, filling up with side dishes especially starch wasn't part of my game plan.  3/5

The service was magnificent. The gauchos were on point and polite. The other servers were generous with the other non meat side dishes. Water was refilled with the efficiency of a military unit under General Patton.   It is truly commensurate with the price of the meal.  Indian restaurants should send their servers here for boot camp.  5/5

From all this gushing , you would expect a 5/5 mark, but the one main negative is price. While the product is good, the price is prohibitive. This is mostly a place for special occasions like birthdays,anniversaries, etc. 
The lunch service is around $30, but Im sure the variety is less compared to the dinner service. Plus, eating this much red meat frequently would make all the gastroenterologists of the world turn into the Hulk.  I cannot say if TGBS is better than Texas De Brazil, Fogo De Chau, and all the other similar , but it is indeed a great special meal in a nice venue with exemplary service.",2019-02-18 03:42:23

JLmpKM9AsEATkkBgLCgQKg,1,"Not good. It was a struggle to order a family meal to go. Hostess was clueless, i was put on hold for about 15 min and next person was as equally clueless. Finally told me to call back in morning. 
Decided to go and order in person the next day. Hostess send us to bartender. He was busy but took our order for pick up the next afternoon. 
Went to pick up and clueless hostess sent me to bartender again, fiod not ready and told to wait.No offer of beverage or water while waiting, and she was also too busy to be bothered with takeout order. 

The food: lasagne was heated according to directions, but was lacking in flavor and kind of chewy. Salad was fresh romaine with cheese and crutons, but no salad dressing in bag or on salad. Bread was too dense for my diners. They also said it didn't have and garlic flavor. It was like garlic butter poured on top, but nothing on the actual slices.
Lastly and the worst was the tiramisu. Looked ok in container, but was a soupy mess. If there were lady fingers they disolved into the coffee flavored goo in the container.  Was there alcohol in it? Opinions were mixed, we did not want alcohol in it. 
We served this meal about 2 hours after pick up, so no excuse for awful dessert unless it was made long before and thawed out.
Nope. Won't  revisit. Typical bland american style chain restaurant. Half of the menu is bar drinks, so maybe that explains all the rave reviews. Side note, there was extra sauce included with no idea what we were to do with it. One was an awful, a garlic parmesan sauce that tasted like it was starting to go sour. 

There was just nothing good about anything.",2021-07-09 23:39:26

Iron skillet itself had such a cozy feel to it and our waitress was super nice, she had such a homey feeling to her. I ordered the country fried steak with a side of pancakes, the BF ordered a hamburger. The food came out on a pretty cool looking skillet and the food was hot. Everything we ordered was good, no complaints. The country fried steak was crispy, well seasoned, and the gravy was not at all plain. The hamburger was cooked as we requested (medium) and it was well put together.

vHc-UrI9yfL_pnnc6nJtyQ,5,"While eating my dinner last week from Bangkok, I couldn't help but feel like I was taking time to reacquaint myself with an old friend. Bangkok was one of the first restaurants I loved in Reno. We'd drive from the NW regularly to enjoy the food, and always loved the lively atmosphere of everyone gathered on a Friday or Saturday night. 

I can still remember the first time I had the Bangkok Sizzling Platter. The fresh spinach was bright green on arrival, but after pouring the peanut sauce over the top you could watch and smell as it sauteed together with the protein all on a sizzling platter. Intoxicating aromas filled the air and the people you were dining with were always jealous they didn't get the same thing. 

As I moved south, I sadly lost touch with Bangkok, as I began to favor the convenience of restaurants closer to me. During API Heritage Month 2021 though, I've been getting out and exploring these spots again, and I'm so glad I made this a priority.

Bangkok has some serious history in the community (25 years to be exact). You can see it in the smiles that fill the room and feel it in the air too. Everyone is a friend from the minute you walk in the door, and after tasting the food, you'll know exactly why so many have been coming for all these years.

On my recent visit I tried the Thai Dumplings, duck larb, black pepper beef, and the fried calamari, all of which were phenomenal. I'm coming back for the crispy duck and the stuffed wings, along with several other dishes that were calling to me but I couldn't have in one visit! 

Bangkok Cuisine was one of the bright spots for me in 2020. While the restaurant industry was facing some of the most difficult circumstances ever, Kris L kept his team focused and motivated through it all, and even found ways to give back to others who needed it more than they did. 

I hope you'll give it a try too!",2021-05-18 00:59:27

_9TJr3HMlhRJBwtASgaCdQ,5,"I grew up in the asian community with a cluster of ethnic restaurants. Later in life, I moved away from this community to pursue a career and to travel the world. That same community was the San Gabriel Valley, an area in Los Angeles that is famously known for Asian food. I found myself in Saint Louis and came across this top notch Taiwanese food. Since then, I've been coming here for about a year, and it is actually one of the best places in Saint Louis. This level of quality, service, and speed is on par as most restaurants in my hometown in the San Gabriel Valley. This place is deserving of all recognitions, being true to its distinct flavor.

Here are some points:

1. The food is quick.  They have a productive army of cooks in the kitchen that does an amazing job.

2. The rice is well-cooked, and it is an important litmus test. Just imagine what could go wrong if an establishment cannot make their rice correctly.

3. The staff are amazing, attentive, and direct. 

4. They give you your bill before you finish your meal, so you can pay them while you are still eating. By the time you're done eating, you can just leave because you already paid by then. This is very efficient!

5. Their dishes are otherworldly --- fried chicken, ground beef with black beans, bok choy, cabbage, and etc. The staff has greatly help me with picking these dishes. 

6. This place is located in the back of the strip mall. It feels a little sketchy, but that's where the best resturant is located at.

I mean literally within seconds of just trying to ascertain an issue he lost control of his emotions and it was impossible to even talk about it.

UWgTtadsPLsyUmi0r94xCA,1,"DO YOU LIKE ARTISTS? SPECIFICALLY SCAM ARTISTS? THEN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!

I bought a cute little Honda Fit here once when I was going through the worst spiral downfall of my life. I needed lower payments, something that would fit all 4 of my big dogs, and something reliable. 

First of all don't go with their loan options, the interest percentages are atrocious. I would recommend going with a credit union and finding the loan yourself. BUT if the car starts having issues immediately and you want to return it there is something you should know. 

My Fit suddenly started having problems that arose just about 48 hours after purchase. Also I can't stress enough CHECK THE CAR FROM TOP TO BOTTOM FRONT TO BACK INSIDE AND OUT. The side of the bumper was coming apart, the trunk would get jammed etc. Things you really wouldn't think about whole test driving.

I returned the car about 2 weeks later as they have a 30 day return policy. They weren't happy and were super rude. They were supposed to send the check that I brought in back to the credit union where I got the loan.
Fast forward one month I get a notification saying I'm past due for a payment on this car that is no longer mine. They never sent the check and they wouldn't tell me what was happening. They even hung up on me when I called in. They would no longer communicate with me.

I ended up calling corporate and complaining. They had it handled in 3 days.

You're better off buying a brand new car tbh. I got a brand new car elsewhere for CHEAPER than this god forbidden Honda Fit.",2021-08-20 18:17:00
kt2OyLZG3ZHd8_UP3jGv-Q,1,"Never seen so many 1 star reviews in my life, but they're all justified. This place just sucks. I have no idea how it can go on like this unchanged for so long. Employees are rude can't be bothered types. Place is filthy because the rude can't be bothered types can't be bothered to do anything but have an attitude and mess up your order. The drive thru is a joke. And when you get stuck waiting in it forever you can't leave cuz there's no way to go around, so you're trapped. They've never once gotten my order right. Never. I'll  ask for BBQ sauce and they'll hand me the bag literally two seconds later without it. And then have an attitude when you ask for it again. Last time, I opened my bag while still sitting there because I was positive it wouldn't be right. I was literally missing 4 things. And I had to ask four separate times for the stuff because I'd tell her about 1 thing missing and she'd slam the door shut go get it and come back so I'd have to keep saying what's missing one by one. Just so needlessly rude. And I have terrible anxiety so I HATE having to ask for the missing things and all that. But what can you do when they don't give you half your stuff! It's honestly the most poorly run fast food establishment I've ever been to in my life. And it's such a shame, because the chicken sandwich is pretty good. The last 2 times I tried to go- I didn't even get served. One time they said they were closed when it was more then an hour before closing time, and the second time they literally just came over the intercom and said they were ""out of product."" It's a Taco Bell/KFC combo, so you're telling me you were out of absolutely everything from both places?! Yeah, sure. The cars in front of us were served, so I'm assuming they just decided they were done early. They seem to do that often. Oh and like I said before, you're trapped in the drive thru, so I had to sit there and wait for the people in front of us who actually did get served to get thru. So I sat in a drive thru for 15 minutes to not get any food. That was the final straw. I'll never go back there. Really wish they would overhaul that place cuz like I said, I really like the food. Would be nice if it weren't such a miserable place to go.",2021-07-22 04:19:09

I am a sucker for grilled seafood so I headed out to Seffner to find this place with the great reviews. Sims food truck is easy to spot, sitting on a corner lot next to a Subway sandwich shop and a motel. I was already impressed just seeing the super large smoker sitting next to it in full swing of preparing what I hoped was a fresh hot meal for me. Just my luck, I was right. I asked for the mullet which was quoted at having a wait of 30 mins, but eventually ended up taking an hour. I wasn't in a rush so I didn't mind. I took the time to find a local store to shop and got back in time to be handled this massive bag with the mullet wrapped in foil. Dang! I didn't know these were so huge! I'm glad that I didn't order any sides, mynbelly would bust. Got my food back home and dug in. Tasted like tuna to me, thick consistency compared to my usual catfish. I got some smoky barbeque sauce for dipping and the meal was perfect! Of course I didn't finish this fillet in one sitting so this covered lunch and dinner for me. Warning for newbies: there are a lot of bones in this so be careful when eating.

Props to the staff, they were super friendly and helpful. I was actually surprised considering it was two young men doing all the work. They nicely advised me to either call in or place my order online to avoid wait times. Good tip for future visits. I just wanted to see what everything looked like up close and personal.",2020-09-30 01:04:52

I was obviously overwhelmed by their options, but she was great! I got two donuts (Cookies & Cream and Sandy Beach) and an iced latte.  The latte was delicious, which was nice considering some donut spots rely on just the donuts. Of course the donuts were incredible. Nashville is home to quite a few donut spots by now, but these stand out to me. The dough itself isn't super sweet, and the texture is just perfect. Because of those factors, the toppings are able to shine more without it feeling like I was eating straight sugar. Perfect donut in my eyes!",2021-08-11 16:07:00

Rufino at JR had his crew, Nick and Joe, come and take a look to see what was wrong. Great guys - very efficient and friendly. They checked voltages etc., and ascertained that it was the LED's that had burnt out. It turns out that whoever installed them used strips that were not suitable for outdoor use. They worked out what would be needed to replace the arrays with units suitable for outdoor/wet conditions. In addition I had them take a look at installing a 220V outlet under our gas cook top as we are planning to go electric, plus installing an outside 120V outlet.
It took a while to get the necessary arrays (Covid is slowing everything down) but once they had them they came immediately and installed them. These were long arrays and installed under concrete coping stones around the curved patio walls. Not a simple task but done beautifully and efficiently. The 220V outlet was done just a efficiently, involving crawl space work, etc. Everything cleaned up perfectly and the outside 120V outlet installed. These guys are consummate pros.

Mi Amor had a bourbon based drink which had some hints if vanilla and cherry in it!!! It was AMAZING!!!! He also tried a coffee bourbon drink which he says was ok, but not as good as the first drink. 

My first drink was a vodka based drink and it was super refreshing! By far one of the best vodka based drinks I've had in a long time! I also tried a tequila drink which was more on the Smokey side. It was ok, not as good as the vodka drink. The tequila started off sweet but then had a Smokey hard after taste which I did not care for.

We also tried the devil eggs of the day which were truffle. They tasted the way they were described, like truffle eggs. They were ok, I wouldn't order them again but I will always ask about the devil egg flavor of the day!

There's also a dip of the day too! They don't have an extensive food menu as they are more of a drink bar, but the little bit of food options they have are the perfect pairing for this spot.

The sauce is robust and there's a good amount on the pies. I can't speak to the many different pizzas they offer because I'm a Hawaiian pizza girl but it is top notch!!!! For pineapple lovers, this pie is for you! For some, the pineapple to ham ratio might be too much for you. There is a lot of pineapples on it. For me, I consider that a perk. Prices are decent! This location is located on streets of St. Charles which is a very crowded area. 

One of the biggest downfalls is the lack of apps offered on the menu. I really enjoy some T-Ravs or garlic knots with my pizza but they don't offer anything of that sort. That's a bummer!!!

For starters, the drinks can be crazy overpriced. And all the hard alcohol is warm. The security is a total joke, there was a night when capacity was hit and they put a biker gang in charge of security. They were only letting in their biker friends, just ignoring most of the people in line. 

And worst of all, the DJ. Where do I begin. She is usually on something. Hammered out of her mind, or completely drugged up. She only plays what she wants to hear, and totally ignores any and all requests that are made (even when people tip her to play something). And she will very often go on these huge ""fuck sisolak"" rants or yell at people dancing if they don't do a dance the way she wants.

MDDdx6uia7LXNDqkUO9w4Q,2,"We tried Paloma's for the first time yesterday getting the crab cake entree for take out.  When we got home, we were surprised that the ""main course"" portion included a single crab cake, a tablespoon or two of wild rice, and a bit of wilted spinach.  The portion filled only about a third of the take-out container.  We are not typically focused on portion size, but this was a little ridiculous for a $24 main course.  We called the restaurant to confirm they did not mistakenly give us an appetizer portion and were told that what we received was the main course.  The entree tasted fine (despite the crab cake being overworked to the point where you could not find any evidence of lump crab meat) but we would have been much happier to have paid more for a proper entree size portion than having to make  a sandwich after eating our dinner!

She said no problem I've made you the first appointment of the day. Dropped the truck off at 0630 and went to work. I've always had great service at whatever Ford dealer I took my trucks to in California. I did not receive a phone call by 1000 telling me my expected cost so I waited until noon and called them my self. They had not even gotten to my truck yet. I informed the girl on the phone that I was picking up the truck by 3pm, she said they were busy. I got there at 3:30pm they still had not got to my truck.

I asked about their 2 year warranty and they said AFTER they replaced the compressor that I would have to pay the entire replacement cost to get my truck back and after they submitted the warranty claim to O'Rileys, and usually 2-3 months later, I would get a full refund check in the mail.  That was over a YEAR ago.  I made many follow up calls AND VISITS to try to get my refund. I kept ALL paperwork.

vHc-UrI9yfL_pnnc6nJtyQ,3,"This one is tough. Asian Paradise was my go to neighborhood Chinese restaurant for quite some time. I can recall sending a lot of great folks there over the years as well. I loved the fact they offered a very diverse menu that represented several Asian cuisines, and that they offered some pretty authentic dishes and versions of popular dishes as well.

I'm reducing my previous 5 star review as a result of two recent experiences here. Truthfully the food served last night was closer to a two, but I know this restaurant does better so I'm giving the benefit of the doubt.

The first was about a mont and a half ago. It was a Sunday evening and we wanted Chinese takeout, but knowing the current status of the restaurant industry, I called to be sure they were open before we ordered. A gentleman answered and affirmed they were open, but politely let me know it was takeout only until about 6/7 due to a large private party that was in the dining room. I let him know I wanted takeout and that id call back in 5 minutes with an order. 

Literally 5 minutes later I started calling. I rang both phone numbers listed for Asian Paradise no less than a combined 50 times (no exaggeration), both simply landing me in a voicemail confirming I was in the right place. I eventually left a voicemail just to see if I'd get a call back, but 6 weeks later and still nothing.

Last night we got to order! Three dishes: Kung Pao Triple Delight dry style, House Pan Fried Noodle and Salt & Pepper Calamari.

The calamari was tough. My son chewed his way through it and I didn't get more than a bite. After that bite I thought about calling the restaurant but decided this must be what they serve and assumed I'd ordered poorly.

The Kung Pao was generally tasty, but several pieces of the beef were extremely tough and inedible. I also couldn't tell if what we got was the dry style. Perhaps it was, just a little more saucy than I'm used to seeing. Aside from the saucy look that I wasn't expecting, it was also hiding a helluva Ma La punch from Sichuan peppercorns. I believe Kung Pao has origins in Sichuan, but if that's the standard here, the Americanized palate needs a little heads up that's coming. I've not experienced that Sichuan flavor profile in this dish at any restaurant that didn't specifically call it out. I enjoy that type of numbing spice, so this was kinda fun for me, but I'd imagine it would be pretty painful for those that didn't know.

The pan fried noodles were the biggest disappointment. I appreciated that they packed the crispy noodles separately from the gravy so we didn't end up with soggy noodles by the time we got home, but the gravy itself was more cornstarch than anything else. This dish is supposed to have a delicate brown gravy that gently coats the protein and vegetables and crispy noodles, but this had way too much thickener and was best described as gloppy and gelatinous. This was not a good version of this dish and was borderline inedible.

So two dishes I didn't want to or couldn't eat and a third my spice loving soul struggled to complete add up to a n  experience that was really not that great. I'm not sure if something changed here during the last few years, but this isn't the Asian Paradise I used to love.",2021-08-03 04:45:37

ZamM2xHZtUJrXWJm9Rvsmg,3,"The atmosphere and decor are pretty cool, the wait staff and employees were super nice. We heard it was a family dining restaurant, so we brought our children with us. (ages 10 and 2) Our 10 year old ordered a bacon cheeseburger off the kids menu. It was GIANT, it was the same size as ours! Our 2 year old also had a burger. (We should have known better and ordered one that they could have split it.) There were no fruit side options for the kids to choose from. 
Due to them running out of highchairs, we were seated in a hightop booth with a booster seat for our toddler. The booster normally wouldn't have been a problem, but it was pretty sketchy having him sit in a booster in such a high booth. We had to scoot the table closer to him so he could reach the table, thus leaving the table short on the other side for the rest of the family. We were told that they were out of high chairs. We finally requested a move to another table after a family with a toddler using a regular high chair left. That made our seating arrangement 100% better. 
The menu is pretty cut and dry...and easy to order from. I got the 317 Burger, as suggested by our waiter. (beef patty, garlic aioli, pepper bacon and cheese) I also ordered the poutine fries. 
The burger looked great on the plate, it was adorned with a bamboo skewer with a pickle on top....
The flavor was not very good at all, the bun was GIANT and dry and the bacon wasn't crispy at all.  The garlic aioli was hard to find, and hard to taste. I ended up taking the top portion of the bun off and cutting the burger with a fork and knife and dipping into ketchup and the gravy from the poutine. 
The poutine was pretty good. The fries were delicious and freshly cut. The cheese curds weren't very melty, but the gravy was great! Overall, that part was what I ate the most of!

I am super excited for this business....but it will be a while before we return so they will be able to work out the kinks.",2013-12-15 15:48:30

The seamstress did not do a great job and charged an exorbitant amount of money. And when wearing the gown for the big day, I kept having to adjust it because it was still too loose in some areas. The store staff is rude and unaccommodating.

RjdZ2sSWY4GREWDp_ms5Vw,2,"What a shame!  This movie house has been renovated and unfortunately, they missed doing it for the customers satisfaction!  

First - what's good:  The heating and air conditioning are great.  In fact, they tend to set the air on super chill, so take boots and socks to keep warm.  The projection and sound systems are state of the art and wonderful.

And then the good news stops.

The seats, while bigger than the previous ones, are still aligned, so you can't see over the head of the person in front of you!  Why, oh why, couldn't they offset the seats so everyone could see?  Then there is the problem of the first seven rows... for some curious reason, these rows are more elevated than those behind them.  Which means that anyone sitting in rows 8-12 cannot see at all!!!!!   My question is this... why didn't they just increase the slope and make it so everyone could see the screen?

The screen has been raised quite a lot, so you would think everyone could see, but it's still a problem.  And, since this theater is all about the interviews with celebrities, why, oh why, didn't they put in a platform so we could see them during the Q&A's?  No one but the first couple of rows can see the interview because the celebrities are seated so low...

And, the promised improvements to the snack bar area are nowhere to be seen.  It's still too small; in the way of entry to the cinema and sells crap snack foods.  Gosh - they moved the popcorn to the opposite side... is this supposed to be an improvement?!  I think not.  And the air-popped popcorn is just as awful as the previous stuff.

Grg4KcIRq7OVt_hBi5KPTA,1,"We've been going to McCordsville Veterinary Hospital for about 5 years, and spending $3,000 for its care in that time.  The Doctors are professional, thorough and attentive.  However, the issue we have is with the front-office staff, the face of the practice.  I've had more than one negative encounter with the check-in staff, but this encounter was inexcusable.  

Our dog injured herself and I wanted to just get an initial assessment on the severity of the wound. My thought was could it wait until I scheduled an appointment for the next day, or should something be done immediately?  

I asked the check-in staff at McCordsville Veterinary Hospital if someone could just take 5 minutes and look at the wound.  I admit, the time was later in the afternoon, but I was told there was no way anyone could see my pet.  I could take her to the Animal Emergency Hospital in Carmel, followed with that ""is all we can offer"". I was also offered an appointment the next day, which I took.

Intuitively I thought the injury wasn't life-threatening, but I wanted peace of mind and the animal's health ensured. I drove to McCordsville Veterinary Hospital and called from the lot, to ask again if someone would just come out and assess our dog's wound.  As I waited with the other two cars in the lot, I was again told it was not possible for anyone to come out. 

I took her to a nearby groomer, thinking she could be helpful.  The groomer gave me her opinion, and a referral to a nearby Vet, Oaklandon Family Vet.  I called that Vet on my way there to explain the situation.  Without any established relationship, or hesitation the Vet said to bring my dog in, but that I may have to wait until they could get my pet in between appointments.  

As I waited with the 4 other cars at the curbside, the Oaklandon Family Vet examined the dog, described what she found and prescribed treatment.  It was all over within 45 minutes after leaving the McCordsville Vet.  

There is this overriding schedule rigidness in the McCordsville Veterinary Hospital's practice that I have experienced more than once.   Even more maddening was when the practice called our home to confirm the next day's appointment.  A Vet from the practice got on the phone with my wife, while I was en-route with our dog to the new Vet, again explaining why McCordsville Veterinary Hospital couldn't see the animal.  I believe altogether my wife and I spent 15 minutes on the phone being told how there was no time to see our dog.  

The Oaklandon Vet has since called us to see how our dog is doing.  That's remarkable service.  They're our veterinarian now.",2020-07-18 16:09:23

j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,4,"Masala Kitchen Kati Rolls and Platters really hit the spot after a long day of traveling. The rolls here were cooked to order and delicious. They were also affordable and served up fast. What more can you ask for?

We had a late check-in at our hotel and were hungry. We ended up leaving our hotel for dinner around 11:15pm. I looked on Yelp for a good, quick, casual place to eat that was also open late. We were tired and I didn't feel like eating at a sit-down restaurant. Masala Kitchen popped up and checked all the boxes. They're open until 3:30am on Friday and Saturday nights. A friend also recommended this place to us.

This is a small fast-casual restaurant located in Center City, just four blocks from Philadelphia City Hall. It's right next to the entrance of a public parking garage. Seating inside is limited to about 24 seats. They have standard two-tops with Tolix chairs and a couple long high-tops with Tolix stools.

During our visit late on a Friday night between 11pm-12am, there was a small, but steady stream of customers. Most of the orders were takeout and delivery. We were the only dine-in customers at the time. The restaurant had plenty of staff on-hand. The kitchen is open. Bottled and canned drinks (from a fridge), sauces, eating utensils, and napkins are self-serve. The space itself is simple and looked relatively new and clean. The ambiance is that of a takeout joint. Since this restaurant is close to a lot of bars, it's perfect for those wanting a late-night snack or meal after a night on the town.

The menu is in the business name: kati rolls and platters. Kati rolls are an Indian street food from Kolkata (Calcutta), West Bengal. Masala Kitchen offers 14 varieties of kati rolls, ranging in price from $4.50 to $5.75 a roll. Buy two kati rolls, get $1 off. One or two rolls is good enough for a meal for most people. Ingredient options include chicken, beef, lamb, paneer (cheese), egg, vegetables, potatoes, Indian spices, and more.

The platters remind me of the platters you can get from The Halal Guys. For example, they have a Chicken-N-Rice platter ($8.75) and the self-serve sauces are similar too -- creamy white and spicy red. In addition, you can get biryani ($9.25-$10.00 each) and a paneer platter ($10). Drinks include mango and rose lassi ($3.70 each), chaas (an Indian yogurt drink, $3.70), masala chai ($3), and more.

The two of us ordered and split the following three rolls:

* Chicken Masala ($5.75) - marinated grilled chicken with Indian creamy tomato sauce ""Makhani"" and crispy onions
* Achari Paneer ($5.50) - marinated paneer with hint of mango pickle sauce, fresh mint-coriander chutney, and crispy onions
* Mix Veggie ($5.50) - fresh pea, carrot, and green bean mixture cooked in Indian spices with fresh mint-coriander chutney and crispy onions plus egg (+$0.50)

These rolls were great. My favorite was the achari paneer, but I'm fan of paneer. Everything was made fresh to order and came out piping hot. Each roll was wrapped in brown paper and Sharpied to identify the rolls.

The kati rolls are wrapped in what the restaurant calls a ""tawa roti."" Traditionally, tawa refers to the round, flat metal griddle used in Indian cooking. The roti here had a nice thickness to it, soft, and kind of fluffy with a sort of pillowy texture, lightly charred and appetizing. I like to describe Masala Kitchen's kati rolls as the Indian equivalent of the Taco Bell Chalupa or Gordita. In terms of the shell/wrap, they are more similar to the Gordita (softer, less crispy, not deep fried).

Each of the rolls was packed with flavor. If you like Indian food, I don't think the kati rolls here will disappoint you. The authentic, aromatic, and mouthwatering flavors were all there. The Mixed Veggie roll had a mushier consistency than the other rolls, but that wasn't surprising given the ingredients. I think adding egg to that roll really enhanced it. On the menu and item descriptions above, ""crispy onions"" refer to fresh, raw slices of red onion.

For sauces, I recommend getting a cup of the white sauce, adding a little bit of red to it, and mixing them together. The red sauce is quite spicy so a little goes a long way. The sauces by themselves are tasty too, so really it's a matter of personal preference. I dipped the rolls into the sauce mixture each time I took a bite. Yum.

Vaishali was our server and she was nice. Masala Kitchen uses the Revel POS system. Transactions, including tipping, are handled on a tablet and you can send yourself an itemized receipt.",2019-07-12 19:07:02

They had a Mongolian grill which was well stocked and excellent. The regular food was a notch above most Chinese buffets and they kept it well stocked. Lots of variety and choices to keep you coming back for more. The deserts were pretty much the same as all the rest of the Chinese buffets in the United States. Luckily watermelon was in season so that was a tasty end to my meal. My buddy and I walked out of there stuffed for less than $25 bucks. I will return.,2021-08-01 20:36:35

Snibkmu9icOiNSKvnQEFNA,4,"I visited El Jefe's on a Sunday evening. I sat at a video poker free seat at the front bar alone. 

I sat there for over five minutes while three staff members, including a manager, buzzed around the bar helping customers and counting inventory. I got up, went to the back bar where the staff were gathered, and told them I was sitting there. 

The manager brought me water and a few minutes later one of the bartenders came over to take my order. He was very friendly! 

I asked for a mezcal margarita. Instead, he made me the signature Cadillac Margarita with a mezcal floater. I'm not a Cadillac fan, but, the acid and savory nature of the mezcal cut through the sweetness of the OJ. It was so good - I ordered a second! 

I ordered the quesabirria (the bartender said it was great and I love it!), however, the kitchen was out (it's a rather special dish, so I wasn't surprised). I asked his other favorite dish and he recommended the Shrimp Diablo Tacos. And yes - he was very genuine in his suggestion. 

It was a hearty portion with refried beans, fresh salsa, rice, and two tacos. 

I requested chips and salsa twice from the bartender but did not receive them. I love crunch with my Mexican food, and I'm happy to pay extra for chips and salsa. I noticed that folks in the dining room around me were getting complimentary chips. However, I noticed people by themselves weren't. Since I did not receive them from the bartender, I asked the runner who brought my food. He had to go out of his way to ask the manager if he could give me chips and salsa. She said yes.

As a woman who travels around the world alone, nothing annoys me more than being ignored, ""missed,"" or denied the same thing as couples or larger groups. Just give me a smaller portion, fine by me. 

Regardless, my tacos were delicious and the chips and salsa were, too. 

Overall, I'd visit El Jefe's again. The design was cute, food was good, cocktails strong, and once I got their attention - the staff was friendly and attentive.",2021-11-18 03:12:29
_yQERMY15jwEKaG8U2LlnQ,1,"Im usually not the type of person to write reviews, but my experience with this practice was one for the books. Unfortunately, 0 stars was not an option so I had no other choice but to give 1 star. I came to this practice to get fitted for orthotics. I was personally told by Jennifer Berlin that my insurance ONLY covers orthotics if I am a diabetic (which I am not a diabetic) and that I need to pay almost $500 for orthotics directly to the office. I personally called my insurance company to verify if this information was accurate, which was not the case. The insurance company informed me that I DO NOT HAVE TO BE A DIABETIC to get orthotics. I called the office back to inform them of my conversation with the insurance company along with providing them with a reference number. The girl Danielle who I guess is the office manager, who felt the need to tell me that she's been in the medical field for 12 years (irrelevant), basically said that she is not going with what the insurance company is telling me since its not accurate info and that I need to pay them 100% of the cost. I find this absolutely insane that this practice refused to go through my insurance company for orthotics and they are even in network with my insurance company!! Total scam and money hungry people. Don't waste your time going here if you have insurance :) Oh and not to mention, the attitude of the staff here is extremely unprofessional.

Webster says:

This company has redeemed itself by handling real problems with real solutions!

Based on the company's response to my previous review,  it is crystal clear that they have taken my problems seriously. Thank you! I received a reply from their business manager,  then their district manager and ultimatey,  the owner.  They were all prompt and helpful,  but the owner was exceptionally thoughtful and concerned for me, the customer, instead of just covering their behinds or giving me the corporate run around, he took the feedback and is using it to remedy any internal problems. Honestly,  that's all I could ever ask of a business, to be open to hearing a customer's perspectiveand to take appropriate action. So refreshing.  If all owners took things this seriously, I would be blown away and I am a former business consultant who knows how challenging that can be for owners and mangers to accept the feedback.  So, if you have any concerns or problems,  don't let them fester, contact this company because of 2 words: they care.  That's a rare thing. 

I don't expect much during a Pandemic,  but I do know money can be tight and PMR can be a real help. 

I believe they have and will tighten up their training and protocols so this doesn't happen to others.",2021-09-10 15:23:20

Here's what's not fine: this places smells like shit. No really, it smells like shit because the dogs (and they are great dogs, don't get me wrong) that hang out in the place use it as their personal piss pad.

qSTp1iN00cF6jJA7H5NOOg,1,"Let me start with the ONE and only good with this complex... Judy! Judy has a great attitude and is really helpful. She is a great asset to this property. 

Now the bad... the manager of this property needs an attitude adjustment. One thing I can say is that if she hates her job so much, leave so she can stop being miserable, and making everyone miserable. This property is poorly managed. Windows and doors are not properly insulated so bugs tend to creep their way in to the apartment. It's a constant problem that they don't seem to care about. Next issue I have is the kids running around the complex like animals. There were several occasions where I almost hit a kid because they simply run out on to the street with no care at all. Next is the parking. If you have a nice car, be prepared to have plenty of dings on your door and a lot of scratches. Another parking issue I have is tenants/visitors tend to park wherever they fell like. If you are on the back side of the complex, between buildings B & C, cars constantly park in front where it is a red zone. God bless the maintenance guy whom I've seen sticking warning stickers on windshield. It tends to stop for a few days, then people start parking thagain. I will attach an example of how considerate these people are. (For example, that van either parks on that road or next to the mustang parked in the handicap, who doesn't ever seem to leave). 

Units are mediocre at best. I will definitely leave this property once my lease is up. My suggestion is, don't make this your permanent ""home."" However, if you're in a financial crunch or would like to save money, this will serve its purpose. 

If you decide to live here, deal with Judy. She's very helpful. IMO, she should be running this place. I'm sure there will be significant improvements.",2017-07-16 01:01:30
dQaHqpAV-nJHm-gysC6YOw,1,"On Friday (3/8) afternoon, I went to the shelter to see a puppy named Cisco. When I got there I went to the front, but was told to go to the back if I wanted to see a dog. No problem. 

When I get to the back, I speak to Susie and explain my situation. 

We were looking for a companion for our dog, Luna, who was once used as a bait dog and struggles with anxiety. She needed a dog friend. 

I didn't hide Luna's history and I showed photos to Susie which showed her lack of fur and scarred appearance. Susie agreed Cisco would be a great option for us because of his calm and easy going nature. I asked if we could bring Luna in the morning to meet with Cisco. She agreed enthusiastically.

Next morning, I walk in and Cisco is covered in dried mud. We got there not long after they opened meaning he probably had that mud on him all night. 

Susie isn't there so I found another woman (blonde) and explain what I discussed with Susie. She and the brunette back there were clearly annoyed I was there. I asked if we could do the meet and greet in the front office's waiting room due to our dog being previously abandoned and we didn't want her to think we were going to leave her. We were denied. They bring Cisco out, in the rain, and as soon as the first woman saw our dog all of her walls went up.

We are completely fine with questions regarding our dog. They are understandable. We are happy to answer questions and provide examples if need be. We also understanding needing to be on your guard during meet and greets. However, the way the looked at and treated our dog was unacceptable.

Luna is obviously nervous but it isn't because of the puppy. It's because of the environment. 

Please note: Luna is mainly ignoring the puppy and not once did she show any aggression. 

The blond woman begins to imply our dog may bite the puppy even though Luna is clearly staying focused on staying with my husband.  We tell her that's never happened and we have a firm handle on her regardless. Despite this, for the next 30 minutes we continue to hear about how we ""just never know"" and about how our dog has the potential to be violent. I wonder if they'd do that if it was a scarred up lab or golden retriever? I doubt it. 

 A brunette wouldn't stop glaring at Luna and even had the audacity to ask if Luna had ""ever even been AROUND puppies?!"" in a hateful, short, accusatory voice while looking at Luna like she's a monster. Luna had puppies herself. 

As soon as they saw Luna, they made their decision on our approval status and they made it very clear. 

During the whole meet and greet, the blonde told multiple stories to try prove ""we just never know"" because she lacked the social grace to realize enough was enough (even after we expressed our frustration at her continuous accusations). She even told a story about how she found out her ""sweet"" dog was racist. Dogs reflect the prejudices of their owners so we found that interesting. She even used a story regarding a dog that'd been clearly overbred to make a point that Luna could suddenly attack. It was unbelievable. The lack of social intelligence was staggering. 

We get the concern (and I'm sure their reaction wasn't meant to be hateful or personal), but they made it clear they believed us naive and it was only a matter of time before ""Luna snapped"". Like we would endanger a puppy for the sake our own desires. The vibes made the whole thing awkward and awful. Dogs can sense that so of course Luna was afraid. I would be too if I had two women looking at me like that. 

I expressed my concerns regarding their behavior to a woman upfront who tried to act like they were just stressed and that they are one of the few to rescue puts (wrong - most adoption places do now - the fact you even see that as a badge of honor is a problem because pits shouldn't be viewed as extra special cases or more dangerous ones). I was met with what felt to be empty apologies and weak excuses. We left and found a perfect puppy at the Humane Society of Sumner County. The people there were incredible and kind. 

This was our first experience with our sweet Luna being looked at like she was a monster. Everyone who knows her loves her. 

Please see attached photos of new puppy (Remus) and our ""dangerous""  Luna - one photo is her and a tripod cat whose her bestie.  

I'm sure the dog will find a good home, but the way they spoke to us and acted towards our dog was beyond terrible. 

TL;DR: the people at this place have no social grace or manners. They make you feel like a burden and judge dogs based on appearance and act like they are the only ones who know much about dogs to the point of acting like they know YOUR dog better than you do...I'm sure they have saved many lives, but they need better bedside manner and kinder volunteers.

A woman working there insisted that Canada and Britain are the same place - I am not kidding!  She wanted to charge a ridiculous amount to mail a package to Canada, so I took it to the Merion post office where they did know the difference and charged half as much!

Nurse and front desk were friendly, however, once the doctor came in, he couldn't keep eye contact with me and acted like I was a waste of time and did not take anything I told him seriously. I let him know of other health issues, some of which I was diagnosed with at St.Judes as a teenager, and he basically went ""Uh huh, sure you do."" Then he referred me to a doctor who specializes in the type of health issue I was diagnosed with at St. Judes, basically acting like he thought I was lying, even though it was not related to why I was even in his office. He didn't test me for anything at all, like I asked, so he basically ignored the reason I was even there just to accuse me of lying about something I was diagnosed with 6 years ago. Then, a few days later, I get a phone call while I was at work saying they had the results of my test. I never had any test done.

They are same group of people to do the cheating I guess!
This is my experience, hopefully will save you out of my situation and save you the money too!!
Got the fridge fixed, and  was told need time to cool, on second day, found totally not working.
Called the number on receipt, was told the customer service will call back in 24 or 48 hours.
Two days passed, no calls. Called again, same answer, so I asked customer service number and called, no answer. So I have to wait, another 4 days passed, nobody called. Called the number on receipt again, was told will let customer service call me in 24 or 48 hours. Wait another 4 days, still nobody called.  The fourth time I called again,  didn't know the lady who answered the phone is same person or not, so every time I have to explain my situation again, and this time after my explaining, she quickly asked my name and told me she just filed my file minutes ago, I knew immediately she was totally lying. 
Feel so frustrated, they even gave me a call, even call me to tell me maybe two parts were broken at same time and they just fixed one will let me feel much better. 
So now I'm sure, this company was totally cheating. 
You only get quick response when you call to fix the appliances. 
Then a cheater appear and fix, told you the fridge need time to cool, take the money and left.
Not working? Call the number again? The answer always will call you back in 24 or 48 hours and never call you again.

Just right after I posted the above reviews, I got a call said he from customer service and said the person worked in customer service before was quit and he just took this position few days ago.

cT90phDGL9wrmNfRKIGTlg,2,"I was in town and needed a place to meet a friend. This place fit the bill the food was tasty and if I just ranked this based on food it would be 4 or 5 stars. 

Walking in, the employees get in your face and yell a greeting. Even pre-pandemic that would have been weird, but now it was too much. People here are complaining about the level of music but it seemed to fit the ambiance for dinner. We were there at lunch and it was still fine (though I was surprised). We were able to get a table by the window because we were the only ones wearing a mask, including the servers. 

Prices are steep but expected. The candied bacon cost more than a dollar a strip. The truffle fries are $$ but have truffle oil so they were amazing, and worth 5 stars alone. I took my leftovers home and ate them for breakfast with a fried egg on top.  

Our server didn't ask how we wanted our burgers cooked and they arrived medium. I hate seeing pink in ground meat, so I was able to eat everything except the center, which I would have liked to have eaten. Not because it was extra delicious but because I was hungry. I should have just finished the fries and ordered a milkshake instead of a burger. 

This place has potential but since I'm only in Boise once every two years, I won't be back.

ogUfd9OwxegyXCBrtFVHyQ,1,"I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, as per the multiple reviews referring to Muskan's horrible attitude and customer service, they are right. 

It was my first time here and I made an appointment with Muskan through Vagaro. An elderly woman did them and I liked them. What I didnt know was that it was Muskans MOTHER who came out and did my eyebrows, despite me making my appointment with Muskan. Since it was my first time going there, I didn't know. It was also never mentioned to me that her mom would be doing my eyebrows instead. 

I made another appointment a month later with Muskan, and a lady who I didnt recognize came out to greet me. Obviously I was confused, because she wasn't who did my eyebrows before, but it was *the real* Muskan who did my eyebrows this time. 

Truthfully, she did a bad job on my brows. They were uneven and left a lot of hair. She also asked very uncomfortable questions and kept making jokes about how she messed up my eyebrows. It was all very odd. 

I let her know about my confusion and how no one told me that her mother would be the one doing my eyebrows. I'm not a confrontational person and was just letting her know that I was caught off gaurd, and that if I knew it was her mom who did my eyebrows first, I would have made an appointment with her mom again. She got VERY defensive and VERY unprofessional, and later called me twice to let me know not to come back.

On a busy Friday night we had a wonderful table outside next to the fountain. Being early December we were a bit concerned about the chill in the air, but it was unseasonably warm so it made the evening enjoyable.

The service was outstanding, but it was the food that was the star. From the starters...the Oyster Pie, sporting plumb and juicy poached oysters in a cream sauce with leeks and artichokes with a generous helping of whipped potatoes....to the house salad that had a wonderful creole mustard vinaigrette... to the entrees, the extraordinary Mississippi Rabbit Fricassee, which served braised in the holy trinity (that wonderful New Orleans base) along with Louisiana popcorn rice, a long and aromatic rice with a side of the most delicious blackened sweet corn bread was incredible. 

To top things off, the pecan bread pudding (a la mode!) was shared by our group as we were truly and happily stuffed.

My gosh, did this change abruptly when I visited Santa Barbara Auto Group and was nicely greeted by Jimmy Triese and said what I had always said in the past I'm just looking around. He said great and not once approached me again. I did find a car I liked and wanted to check the Carfax report, etc. and called him the following day asking if the car was still available. It was and with a no pressure approach he just said you'ret welcome to test drive if you ever decide you would like to. I met with him the next day and he handed me the keys and encouraged me to take a 20 minute+ drive as this would likely give me enough time to get a feel for the car. It's truly the only time I've never had pressure put on me by a car salesman and fortunately the car was one I thoroughly enjoyed. Jimmy handled the rest of the purchase journey quickly and easily for me. 
It was a wonderfully unexpected, no pressure, experience.

knwK1zwTWQylqEvGkVWzog,1,"The one star is for the sweet assistant who did my teeth cleaning. 
This was an office I found online, is close to home and accepts my insurance. I have a chipped molar (#31) that has become infected and needed to see the dentist ASAP. They got me in, racked my insurance for X-rays of my entire mouth, despite the current X-rays I brought of the tooth. That should have been my first clue but I was in pain and my teeth are in bad shape so I overlooked it, hoping to get my cracked tooth fixed or removed. 
He gave me antibiotics and pain meds and the lovely assistant cleaned my teeth. 
After looking at my X-rays, Dr. Kopp was almost judgmental about the condition of my teeth and spoke to me in a tone that can only be described as condescending. I freely admitted right away that I had neglected my teeth for a bit and that certain medications I had been prescribed, also took their toll. 
He was quiet, non communicative, and just looked at my X-rays, told me I have a few cavities and also need some root canals..... very vague.....so I had to pry the info from him like which teeth, what was covered, etc etc. 
I scheduled the extraction of the cracked tooth, and granted, it really hurts, but I waited two weeks. That morning they called and cancelled me because the doctor ""had a head cold"". 
So I then rescheduled.....3 weeks later, still in pain, out of antibiotics at this point and I get a phone call two hours prior to my appointment to say that the doctor has decided I need to see a dental surgeon for my extraction and would not be removing my tooth. 
*** Mind you, online it says they do oral surgery***
He could have told me this from the beginning and I could have had the tooth removed five times over by now but instead, I waited, trusted the doctor, gave him the benefit of the doubt with his ""head cold"" non sense all while being in pain, that escalates daily due to the infection. 
That is not very good ethics, or bedside manor as far as I am concerned. He let me go on and suffer while awaiting services promised by their office that were never provided. 
Steer clear of this facility, they are out to charge up insurance plans and if you aren't a big money investment, they will invest no time on your dental needs.

- Vietnamese egg coffee (5/5), never had this before and upon reading the description, thought it would be very sweet. We asked for less of the egg and milk blend and was pleasantly surprised how well balanced it was. After blending the coffee with this egg/milk blend the sweetness subdued significantly. This is coming from a person who thinks traditional Vietnamese coffee with the condensed milk could be way too sweet as I'm used to drinking coffee black.

- Vietnamese drip coffee (4/5), we ordered both a hot and cold version. I recommend the hot version. To be honest, I thought the coffee was too acidic for my liking.

Sheesh, my Mid-City Rouse's can't hold a candle to the selection of hot food and deli food that this one has. I got so excited I think I bought enough food for like multiple lunches and dinners! Unfortunately I'm not a hobbit so some of this may end up getting frozen! Hehe

Some of my bounty from the hot food included red beans and rice with sausage, lasagna and meatloaf (ok I'm Asian so meatloaf still fascinates me!). And from the behind the glass part I got the seasoned salmon and the skirt steak with bell peppers and onions!

I also bought the Gentilly Berry cake (Rouse's take on the Whole Foods Berry Chantilly cake which is my all time favorite cake, probably bc I hate sweet icing and it's a perfect balance of cake, fruit and not super sweet icing) for my friend to celebrate her new job! They were kind enough to add my message on there for my friend!

There is such a vast selection of food it kind of makes me wish this rouse's was the one closest to me!

I supplied a sink model number (under-mount), showed them the sink, showed them the faucet (as instructed). He said it was an over-mount sink, despite my initial remnant order being for an under-mount cut, and I trusted that they knew what they were talking about and maybe I ordered something different months previous. I also trusted that since I gave them the sink model number and cutting template, they would figure out the final cut correctly. It was cut incorrectly for my sink. Sink replacement = $1400+2 months, counter = $910.

I was stuck and just had to take a new counter, which they supplied for 50% the original cost (what a deal??) despite no new template being required, just a new remnant and install. In the end, I believe they still made money on the new counter despite them being somewhat at fault for the incorrect cut. They are a business and could have written it off.

VHvmnMAnKvqZIxH63BaF5w,4,"Lots of wonderful purchases from this local greenhouse over the years. How I haven't posted a review yet, I'm not sure. Every time I've shopped here for myself or with others, I leave feeling like I've found more than what I thought I needed (great for any gardener to feel that happiness and this was certainly true on my most recent visit). 

If you're looking for seeds, plants, ready to eat veggies & fruit, various garden maintenance items, home & garden accessories or decor items, this is a great place to shop. If you're on a time or budget limit, you might need to go in with someone else to help you focus and cover more ground. There's always a lot to look at and if you go often enough, there's even a stamp card to fill up (I won't go into the details, as another yelper explained that really well already). 

The last visit I'm recalling (in Aug 2021), I noticed they had a decent discount on remaining vegetables, herbs and flowers for your garden. To a point it distracted me from my original mission of buying veggies for my upcoming meals. Well only a little... as I bought some lovely mature herbs of basil, stevia and chives to add to my patio garden. I stocked up on the veggies I went there for but made a note to myself about the cases of BC fruit. I'm writing this review now as I forgot it in drafts and found it again when sharing this location with relatives and friends. Most recently my Aunt picked up potatoes from there (Oct 2021), so the food area is still available as well as all the neat extra things closer to the tills.

Parking lot is large enough one wouldn't struggle to find a spot, it's flat and it's paved. The entrance/exit is both flat, making it welcoming for all levels of mobility. 

The signs could be a bit more strategically placed so one actually goes into the right greenhouse area for plants, types of flowers, veggies & fruit (fruits & veggies were at the far end of the connecting greenhouses but in the past years the veggies & fruit were close to the exit & tills). 

I also passed a lot of staff in the greenhouse but no one asked me if I was finding what I was looking for, if needed help with anything I was looking at or if I knew that they were closing up soon. It wasn't until I reached the till I realized what time it was with all the staff gathered near the exit waiting for the greenhouse to close. That was an odd feeling but I appreciate the cashier & what I assume was the owner for still taking time to chat with me and make sure I knew about the punch card and had everything I needed. 

While exiting, I noticed a bunch of very happy greenhouse cats and one very lovely old greenhouse dog. Something about greenhouse that keep animals always makes me smile just a bit more.",2021-11-22 04:30:21
0CLG1DAJRt5YtgYqemv4Bw,1,"I was very excited to get my lashes done because I haven't done them in over a year since being pregnant and having my daughter. I've gone to great salons all over the Tampa area but never in St Pete before. There is no receptionist here so you are greeted by whoever is doing your lashes that day. It's not the most professional environment. The girl who was doing my lashes was blasting awkward cursing rap music. Not so relaxing but I didn't care too much and brushed it off. It took almost 3 hours to do my lash set which is longer than I'm used to. 

Throughout many times my lashes burned and once we were done and she showed me the set I couldn't open my right eye because there was glue on the inner corner which burned badly. I let her know and she cut it off. It looked pretty and not completely even on both sides but I was still happy. 

Their Instagram page promises a retention of 3-4 weeks. After one week more than half of my lashes came off, I messaged the owner to let them know and all she did was offer 10 dollars off of a fill. Why would I get a fill from here again!? these lashes last a week! I paid over $100 because I didn't do their $59 special since those are done by technicians who are learning and just graduated from training. No thanks! 

So disappointed by this as I wasted my hard earned money. I know the discounted rate is tempting because I fell for it too but if you're reading this DO NOT do it. It's not a nice, pampering salon experience and at the end of the day these lashes last a week. What's the point? Better to pay a little more and actually have good lashes without glue stains that will actually last you for a month. Very disappointed.",2019-03-24 20:10:48
1Va9eT5zW2hbC9iEWva_CA,2,I went to Poco's today for the first time in about 15 years and I doubt I'll ever go again.  The most positive thing I can say is that the service was prompt and friendly and the new addition was spacious.  My Mom and I were both surprised there wasn't a lunch menu and were even more surprised by the prices.  1 taco was $4!!  Given the high prices we decided to split the fish tacos and order a side of rice and beans as well as a small order of guacamole.  The fish tacos were ok but at nearly $12 I felt a little ripped off by the minimal amount of fish and the large amount of cabbage!  The rice was basic at best.  The refried beans I'm sure were from a can.  And the small side of guacamole...less than 2 ounces and cost $3.50!  Our bill came to $25 (including 2 ices teas).  Next time I want Mexican I'll go a few minutes up 611 to El Mariachi (much more authentic with much friendly prices.,2013-08-05 02:00:18

The customer service was decent, but nothing remarkable. I'll be back if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.

We eventually parked in probably what was someone else's lot to be honest, but they sort of run together. The crowd was pretty quickly dispatched, but unfortunately, there was no coffee ... neither dark roast, or the light dish water stuff. I mean none.

Great gift shop, roomy and lots of choices of different items..
The acoustics are good.

Because of our time constraint and a lot of little hiccups we've had with the city and getting permits at the last minute, they made it super easy for us and made time for us when they didn't really need too since it was really my fault.

I live in St.Pete with no ST close to me.  This ST location is always such a jam-packed, chaotic, circus of a line-waiting and noisy ""adventure,"" that my family just prefers to make the drive and dine at the ST in Palm Harbor...)

I'm a proud carnivore and the nearly-meatless Sweet Tomatoes may still be my favorite chain restaurant in our area!

It is a bit pricey for a soup/salad bar/bakery buffet, but I think it is well worth it for the quality and selection.  Check your Sunday paper ads for a coupon.  It helps a bunch.

The pre-assembled salad creations are great and the make-your-own salad selection is likely the most expansive you've ever seen.  I would eat a salad like this every day if I had enough energy to prep the ingredients.

But it is their Yankee Clipper clam chowder that keeps me coming back, over and over.  It is a magical, creamy delight, with lots of clams and french-fry-sized pieces of potato.

I like to grab a piece or two of their great parmesan focaccia to DIP (when nobody is looking, of course!).

Their chicken noodle soup is also very well done, with giant pieces of shredded chicken and chunky, homestyle noodles.

The bakery offerings are always excellent.  The cornbread and blueberry muffins definitely earned their ""black belts,"" and could compete and win with any bakery dojo!

My only food complaint?  Eh...  The pasta?  Seems to be just cooked noodles, tossed in a sauce in a wok?  For shame!  REAL macaroni and cheese is born from an oven!  You know, with the cheesy and CRUSTY top?  You start doing that here and you will win over many more fans!

We ordered the jackfruit taquitos and the jackfruit burrito and they were both DELISH!  We had the vegan ""Teese"" and vegan ranch dressing with the taquitos, and you could barely tell that they were vegan options.

Obviously if you're not a fan of smoking, then this place isn't for you. I'm personally not a big smoker myself, but my boyfriend and I had a wonderful time sharing a cigar here. They have a large assortment of cigars displayed in glass cases stretched along the side of the room. Since there is a great variety in price, you have the option to select something cheaper if you're not willing to spend much or you can buy something much more expensive depending on your taste. Once you've purchased your cigar, you can head on over to the other side of the lounge to the bar where you can purchase beverages ranging from simple espressos to beers and sangria. My boyfriend and I chose to pair our cigar with their homemade sangria and we were not disappointed! Afterwards, you can sit outside and people watch on Ybor or you can choose to sit inside the lounge on their nice leather couches and chat with company or watch sports.

The breakfast menu is pretty intriguing, with a handful of savory dishes and some over the top sweet ones. I couldn't keep my eyes off the cookie dough french toast, so ended up having to order it. I wasn't upset by that at all. It definitely had the cookie dough flavor you'd expect, and wasn't overly indulgent like I thought it might be. 

My friend agreed to split with me so we could try a couple of options, so we also got the salted caramel banana stuffed french toast. That one was a miss, imo. I ended up not even finishing it because it just didn't really work out well with the flavors or the layered bananas that kept making it slide over.

I probably should have gotten the tofu scramble, one of the few vegan options on the menu, but my sweet tooth took over today. Don't regret it, but probably won't do it again.",2021-12-19 02:11:53

Tria was actually an accidental find for my boyfriend and I. We were wondering around looking for a place to eat on a Sunday afternoon when we walked by it and decided to go. Best unintentional win ever.

WHAT I GOT: Breakfast flatbread with a side of potatoes
WHAT HE GOT: Duck scrapple with a side of bacon

PROS: Portion sizes are pretty hefty so you'll be eating your money's worth in delicious, perfectly cooked food. My breakfast flatbread was loaded with bacon and potatoes all stacked on top of a melted bed of a herb cheese mixture. Absolutely delicious. My boyfriend got the duck scrapple, not knowing what to expect since this was his first time having scrapple. He's not a fan of the texture or the taste too much but paired with the perfectly poached egg Tria serves with it and their amazing beer-naise sauce, the dish is doable. He absolutely fell in love with their bacon though. Aside from their brunch menu, their regular menu options are also delicious. My boyfriend is an avid fan of the beer burger. We usually always go when there's not that many people so the atmosphere is quite nice. Cozy and intimate. The waiters are also extremely friendly and super accommodating.

They didn't have the one we wanted in stock, and even though we needed something quick and they wouldn't be able to deliver/install until the following week, we wanted to support a local business... so we went with Gerhard's--especially since they promised to get it here ASAP. Big mistake. 

We were told by the sales person that we pay our service person when they are here to install. Install day comes around, my husband stays home from work to let them in--day before we're scheduled to have this baby--and they don't put it on the truck because we're told we needed to pay the day before, and there's no way to get it before.

We regret not going with Lowes or Home Depot, as we could have had a dishwasher several days before, at the beginning of the week. Additionally, after calling throughout the day to talk to the sales person or get information from ANYBODY, we were consistently blown off by their staff with the promise of calling us ""right back"" in a few minutes, and never hearing from them until we called again.

The entrees soon followed and while also properly prepared there was nothing really special about them.  Prices were good,  we paid around $60.00 for dinner and two cocktails.  Wait staff quickly cleared the table once we were finished, but took a while to bring the check and the server  immediately took off even as I was trying to hand him the credit card.

Family owned and operated since 1986, Leo and Devon (and their awesome team), are simply the best at what they do. They are hardworking, honest, and always do what's in the interest of their customers. 

Tire Century has consistently performed accurate and reliable diagnostics on my truck. Not only that, but they have such reasonable repair prices and are quick and efficient. They do what they promise, every time. If they tell you your oil change will be a half hour, it will be a half hour, every time. If they aren't sure what's going wrong, they will tell you. You get the idea. 

They are exactly the people you want to hand your automobile over to. If you are someone who knows little about cars and dreads being taken advantage of, this is the place to bring your car. They take the time with every customer, no matter how knowledgeable they may or may not be, to explain what is going wrong and what solutions look like. No ultimatums or pressure, just low-key people making a living doing what they are so good at, auto-everything. 

Leo and Devon, thank you so much for running a trustworthy car business in Saint Louis City!

We have three cars in our family now, and we will bring them all to Century Tire...they are the best!",2018-06-13 17:03:42

mGbn9P6Cl9FQCwfQWcA5CQ,1,"I've only ever given one other 1 star review, but this was such a fustrating delivery experience that ended in a sad, sad meal. 

- 1st call: asked to place an order for delivery and was put on hold, but they dropped the line. 

- 2nd call: ordered two 'za: one sausage, one plain. Before I could ask how long and if they take card or just cash, they hung up on me. You'd think they'd provide that info ...

- 3rd call: told them I just placed an order for delivery but had some questions. They confirmed the order, and once again promptly hung up before I could get another word in!!

Now this was just absurd! 3 calls and they couldn't bother to provide you with any of the basic info. So not knowing what to expect, I scrambled to collect enough cash and just waited around, along with 4 hangry men who just spent all day performing physical labor.

Approx. 40mins later, the food was here, and man oh man I have never seen a sadder looking pizza. Chuck e Cheese put this greasy, listless pile of dough and cheese to shame. The guys could barely eat 2 slices each ... and believe me when I say I've seen some of them them eat a day's worth of food in one sitting.  

Needless to say, I won't be back.",2019-06-07 13:10:49
l-WrCoGh4n7b6nGaTXhJNw,2,"We've been to this location several times and had some good meals. Until Saturday night. We got a family pack for dinner. The food itself wasn't bad, flavor wise. But something wasn't right with it. All three of us spent the rest of the holiday weekend paying for our choice. It wasn't full on food poisoning, but it wasn't good. Within an hour or so the food felt like a rock in my stomach. And the indigestion was horrible. My boys didn't get that but they paid for it once it made its way out of their system. Me too. We went though quite a few Imodium to get through it. We've never had that happen before at Dickies. What happened?

Yeah. I don't believe we'll be returning any time soon. We'll drive into town for Dave's.",2019-05-28 16:39:02

djxnI8Ux8ZYQJhiOQkrRhA,3,"Because I'm the member of our household who does a majority of the cookin' and cleanin' (yes I own an apron... and proud of it!), getting groceries on the cheap is very important! Also, I'm a little peeved at Schnucks and how their downtown Culinaria is chipping away at the foundation of other downtown stores. Picked Shop 'n Save this week instead, even if it is a little further away than Culinaria.

If you are looking for canned food or pasta, Shop 'n Save is great. And  inexpensive. They also offer some good prices on meat (which I love) and cereal (for the BF). The shelves and aisles are clean enough and the bagging area is usually stocked/ready for use.

However if you are looking for fresh produce, Shop 'n Save is not the place! Also, if you live with a lactard and require fancy milk, Shop 'n Save doesn't carry it. And it's tough to find help when you need it...

Would I go there again? Probably. I like exploring options beyond Schnucks and Dierbergs in the area while saving a few bucks at the same time. If I need fresh produce I'll just run by the Soulard Market on my way to work or on a Saturday afternoon.",2009-11-16 00:52:16
FILUmFX4fueKJdnHhjadag,4,"This should be a 3.5 star review, but I rounded up since Yelp did not have the option  

The food at this venue is very well made and honestly comes out pretty quickly if the food is ready. The venue is clean and has a very ""small pub"" feel to it (not unsimilar to Finns Mccool down the street). It's charming and cozy above all else. 

The staff, from my experience, is very hit or miss. My first time here we had a very welcoming young lady who  served us really nicely. The second time, we had a young man who seemed both rude and aloof to basic conversational skills. There is nothing wrong with this, as I was not offended, however this needs to change if you expect to grow your reputation as a restaurant in the area. People will not always find this appealing (if at all). 

Lastly, I wanted to touch on the food situation. We arrived after the lunch rush and it seemed that the staff needed about one hour to get wings and burgers ready; they had literally none. This is already a logistical nightmare for a restaurant that opens all day, but what really surprised me was the staffs inability to keep people here at all. I saw 5 parties of people come and leave while my lady and I decided to wait and ate fries to mull over the wait time.  This should not happen, in my opinion. Offer the guests a discount, complementary sides to wait, maybe a free drink too?.... But keep them at your venue! You've effectively made even a discounted sale into nothing and thus have shown those people your inability to serve food at certain times of the day, as well as the inability to retain customer satisfaction. In my opinion, the staff needs to learn a thing or two to elevate this venue from good to great, but the potential is there and I eagerly await their acceptance to this challenge",2021-11-14 14:08:40

6XhemL5EkY2pT0Lnwodm6A,5,"I just moved to Philadelphia from Miami, so I know my share of good and bad restaurants/lounges. I received a friend request from Shouk Lounge on MySpace and thought it looked like a cool place. So my roommates and I went to have dinner, drinks, and of course, a hookah. 

As soon as we got there, I immediately liked the decor and feel to the place. Its dimly lit with tons of candles. They have a bunch of art hanging on the wall, the music was a good selection of things I don't normally listen to, but like none the less. 

We ordered Israeli fries and these lentil fritters which were really good, but above all else, their Moroccan martini is AMAZING! If you come here, you MUST give it a try. I am not a martini person, but I was won over with this one. For dinner I had this steak with a thick olive paste on it which was really really good. If you like olives, you will love this! For our hookah, we ordered the melon flavor which was great and not very smoky to inhale... I'm not a smoker, but smoking out of a hookah was fun. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helped us out with this whole hookah thing, since we were all new to it.  

If you are looking for a nice romantic date place, Shouk is also great. If you and your date are ok with the smell of smoke and being around it, I would definitely recommend it! I have been back to Shouk many times to have drinks with friends, and I always order my Moroccan martini!

I give it 5 stars!! *****

0Cwus8T5TL7AqKa3iAqyFw,4,"It's stitll a hit of 4 stars and that's pretty much close to perfection. I could not go to any italian restaurant (yet) in the area because i think of mangia. I have eyes to other italian restaurants but mangia give me the reason to come back. Tonight is its grand opening of the new extension of dining seats. To celebrate this event, I ordered the mangia house special of pasta specialities for the first time. I like the taste as usual. However, pasta is not homemade but by Barilla or supermarket noodles and tomato sauces. People who eat here are patrons and from the area. Customers talk to each other from across/near seats and express satisfaction to mangia's service but most specially, it's food. And the best of all is the reasonableness of the food price. I hope though that if price change, it won't be drastic increase or would remain the same. The dining facility is quite simple, not elegant or sophisticated; it's a pizzeria style environment, but it works fine. Music is jazzy but too loud, and like the music you'll hear in chain Olive Garden. The lighting is adequate. The grand re-opening is an expansion of space, an extension of more seatings on the other side. There was a need for more seatings as customers come back and seatingare  close to each other.",2010-10-24 01:22:38
5O3VvfDu_HDvgUviAqmTEA,2,"After reading all of the positive reviews for Rise Pies on Yelp my husband decided to pick up a few pies for dinner tonight.

We tried the Margherita and the Hawaiian pizza and they were both terrible. The Margherita pizza was the better of the two, but this pizza was so salty. The Hawaiian pizza was barely edible and was covered in a sickening sweet barbecue sauce. The only positive thing I can say about the pizza is that the crust was amazing. The crust was super thin and perfectly chewy, but unfortunately we were not fans of the sauce.

I think I will stick with Grimaldi's if I am craving pizza.",2016-01-13 03:08:38
NsKJ7A1hSZ1XUdHui6bDSg,3,"Here is what I think.
For $200+ a night, it isn't worth it for a business trip.  If I'm here to party it may be, but it's all work and no real play.
Pros-
The staff is on point, they are  great! 
The rooms are spacious. 
They have a shuttle that runs every 30 minutes.
Cons-
Walls are thin, I can hear the man snoring in the room next to me.  I had to run the AC all night to drown them out because they were loud at night and then turn it lower when he woke me up with his snoring. 
Which leads me to needing extra blankets in the room, this thin blanket isn't enough.  
Or add ear plugs to the bathroom, which isn't unusual, as you can also hear the street traffic very well. 
I most likely won't be returning here, if I did it would be for your staff, they really are that great!",2018-04-19 09:28:39

I called them asking for an estimate on a windshield for my 2016 VW CC; they gave me good price and an appointment for my onsite installation. The installation day I got called and they were ""faking"" to be ready to come and install the windshield, but suprisingly they had the ""wrong"" car model, so they had to reschedule. I got reschedule by a very mean and nasty woman over the phone without any idea about phone etiquette or customer service. The new appointment day nobody showed up and nobody called. The hours they give are 8:00am to 5:00pm but they dont even care about calling you. I called them the next day, and the same nasty lady just told me they dont have the part and I have to go to the dealer. A whole week lost on this process and now I have to go to the dealer. This people should not schedule any appointment until the have the part; and the ones taking the phone calls definitely need some coaching. Thank you very much for nothing!!",2019-04-07 23:06:16
37ztQXVgezRc6qnYGp--hg,2,"VEGAN EATERS HERE.....To be honest, the tag might better read ""Should have been better"".  If you know me, there is no bigger fan of restaurants in general. I rarely write a bad review, I just don't say anything. This is something that needs saying and, there will be no photos this time.

We've been going to Mesa Verde for almost seven years now and at times considered it our favorite (V) restaurant on the Central Coast. The food was spectacular, the presentation was always equal to the food, the creativity and  thought given to each element of the eating experience was simply remarkable.

Then, a while back, things started to fail and yes, I'm taking into consideration covid19. The quality started getting spotty, the service erratic, the ambience less inviting and the food, always the mainstay was inconsistent.

While in Santa Barbara the other day we decided to take a chance and revisit for lunch. To be honest, we were simply stunned. The menu was much smaller and literally dirty, and the prices had jumped to an alarming degree. The vibe was so flat, the only welcome came from the busser.

We ordered the street tacos and the green bowl to share between us. The prices were shocking, both $22.00 nearly double the previous prices, the presentation was beyond lackluster with the tacos arriving on a plain white plate, not the wooden planks they used to use, no garnish, just three tacos which comes to over $7.00 each? 

The bowl wasn't much better but we figured we bought it so eat it. Both dishes were so salty as to be nearly inedible. We mentioned this to the server who shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Water was never refilled, no dessert offered, not that we would have ordered one at this point and, they range from $13-14.00 each. 

To say that Mesa Verde is no longer what it once was isn't even close to the disappointing experience. This place used to be a Mecca for vegans and non-vegans. The food/service/ambience/quality was remarkable. Now it is simply sad, even the restroom was dirty. 

I prefaced these comments by saying I am fully aware that Covid19 has created countless problems for restaurants, some have made it and some have not. Some have flourished and some have not which is the case here. It would take a lot to get us to return or bring any of the many friends and family we've introduced to MV over the years.

It gives me no joy to say any of this but it's not my restaurant, I have been a very good customer for many years so not one of the malcontents here who never even ate at a restaurant and gave it 1 star for not getting in. Nope. 

I sincerely hope they wake up and give up the ghost or pull it together. Everyone deserves better.",2021-12-06 02:09:01

I recommend sitting outside cause the sound of the Honda $h!t boxes driving by sound better than the speakers inside that are about to blow themselves off the wall. (This is coming from someone who runs a jack hammer all day and plays drums in a Norwegian death metal band.)
Food is pretty good. Cost more than it should based on the tiny portions, in my opinion. 
Beer is good but some taste the they have dish soup in them. I usually get plastered after two ipas even though I drink a 30 pack of miller light on a daily basis (prob high sugar content )

The second time was a bad experience. We reserved a table for a party of 8 for my husbands birthday. We arrived 5 mins before our reservations and we're told our table isn't ready yet but should be soon. After waiting for 40 mins, our table was finally ready. This put a damper on our plans for the rest of the night because we were sat so much later than we were promised. Everyone said the food was okay but they would not return because it wasn't anything special plus the service wasn't good. We asked if there's anything they could do to make up for us being sat late, they said there's nothing they could do... this further disappointed everyone.

8690gLMZkjXU3xzV-DObTA,5,"Between new dental insurance and some really bad experiences at other dental offices, I decided to try Aland Family Dentistry. I'm glad I did. I also really lucked out and receive my initial-new patient consultation and cleaning on the same day. 

The dental hygienist, dental techs, and his staff are super friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable. The tech taking my periapical xrays was really concerned and patient with my 'really bad gag reflex' and did everything she could to make the procedure as painless and as quick of a process as possible for me.  She didn't get viable annoyed when I kept involuntarily ""spitting out"" the film. Periapical xrays films are my mouth's kryptonite, so I really appreciated the techs' patience with me. 

The dental hygienist cleaning my teeth was very through in both her work and with discussing my 'problem areas' I need to address before my next cleaning, answering my questions, and giving me advice.

Lastly, Dr. Aland was the same as his staff - polite, profession and very informative. Unlike many dentist he didn't list a lot of work that needed to be done or recommend work - besides just getting back on a cleaning schedule and flossing. He made certain to answer all my questions.

If you are not, don't bring your guy here. Their skirts do occasionally lift up or things of the sort when they pick stuff up ( they are real waitresses) . 
It's like Hooters, but a little classier. Thank god they weren't wearing tube socks. These waitresses (like their counterparts) go for the girl next door thing. They sit in the booth with you or at your table, very casual. I dont really like this whole sitting down with you thing at a restaurant. But hey, maybe men do and frankly, I'm not the tilted kilts demographic, men are. 

The draft list was extensive, a big plus for me. I would have tried one if I wasn't already wasted by the time we got here. So we just ordered wings and fries. They have some late night happy hour thing. So we got fries for $2 and an order of wings, full priced at $10.50 for 8 pieces. The wings were good, we got that sweet and spicy sauce, but we could have used more, especially for that price.  The fries were in a 16oz glass with a liner so not very much.

This location is right next to Pastaria in the heart of Clayton.  Parking is just above the restaurant in the garage and YES they do validate parking!  
When you first walk in you think you're in VEGAS not a sushi restaurant.  Very modern and chic decor.  The customer's walking in were definitely dressed the Vegas part. Thank god I brought a change of clothes after running the 80's/90's Fun Run in Forest park that evening.  

We ordered almost everything on the menu and somethings twice.  
My only 2 complaints were 1) the sushi menu was a little difficult to follow.  The names rarely help you with what is in the roll, 2) Some of the portions were a little small.  
That being said the quality of the food was excellent.  The roll that stands out the most of course is the flaming Oh My God roll.  The fire added just the right amount of smokiness to the sushi that was quite unique.

After four nights of insomnia and headaches due to my back and neck pain I called H & J Spa and was able to schedule a 90 minute deep tissue massage for the next day. I'm always a bit nervous trying someone new but the massage I got was fabulous and just what I needed.

First the facility is very pleasant and clean, I felt immediately at ease. I was taken back to one of the massage rooms right away, given plenty of time to prepare, and I liked hearing a timer start at the beginning of the session (I've been to other places that cheat on time, one reason I avoid the big chain massage places that tend to overbook.) My massage therapist got right to work and used a variety of techniques to really work deep into my muscle knots, just the way I needed (and I could tell she could feel right where my worst spots were at). I really felt like I got the benefit of my full 90 minutes as she worked on everything from my scalp to my hands to my toes--with plenty of time on my aching back.

With a side of potatoes and an English muffin, the portion was just right. Not hungry, and not too full.

They already have pitchers of water and coffee on the table before you sit down. Since there is complimentary coffee while you wait, I assumed that the coffee already set on our table was also complimentary. Incorrect! We got charged for it. 

Funny that some of these reviews I'm reading praise the service. I thought our service was only ok. When we were ready for some boxes and the check, our server was nowhere to be found.

MfU5dHFM91wnKwFCacwXZQ,1,"Wish I had seen the ""F"" BBB rating for this company before I ordered 14 Hunter Douglas shades.  After months of waiting and excuses, we finally got the shades installed.  A few days ago, I called to see if I could purchase some rail and parts to convert a couple of the shades to the top-down style and was rudely informed by the owner through an employee who was trying to be helpful that the owner wouldn't touch it!  Oh no--she would rather make me spend $600 on three new shades, than sell me a few cheap parts to do the simple conversion myself.  I've restrung many of the 50+ Hunter Douglas shades I've purchased over the years, so know that it's not rocket science.  Rather than work with me to re-purpose perfectly good shades into the style I need, the owner wants to extract another $600 from me!",2015-07-27 16:15:33

Forgot my card and went back and came straight to the front where other guest were totally ok with the quick hold up. I get to the front once again and the employee by the name Julian I believe literally walked away seeing I'm there to go and talk amongst himself and another coworker away from the front. Everyone is confused he says nothing in regards to he'll be right back he just ups and leaves. Then an employee by the name of Emma comes along and starts seeing what I ordered. No ""apologies miss"" nothing. Then my food did not even have sauce on them and I ordered them 20 minutes prior. How do you forget sauce on something that says what sauce. I then get them back and I see it's STILL dry literally some looked like nuggets. Again no apologies allow me to fix this order for you. She just sat there looking confused. Meanwhile Julian comes back while there's at least 5 people behind asking ""are you all for pick up"" well I believe we all were sir but you were too busy chatting with a fellow employee. If I couldn't rate this I would just because of the poor service and professionalism. We all have bad days however what I received was beyond unacceptable.",2019-03-11 21:23:56

My bestie told me her and her boyfriend go there every other Saturday because it's her favorite so we HAD to try it after brunch at Seven Troughs (the whole Basement is amazing and if you haven't checked it out, you should! Lots of gems here (: .
They have an array of specialty lattes and I'm a sucker for lavender coffee. I got a Lavender Vanilla latte (I can't remember the names of the lattes, I was full and had some mimosas so forgive me) and she got some kind of honey latte with a cloud topping. Which, if you love delicious, cinnamon foam this get the Cloud topping! I regretted not getting it with mine and I think it might be my new obsession. 
Next time I'm in the area, I'll definitely be stopping for some cloudage. 

They had some pastries on display, A cute area for Instagram worthy pics and lots of comfortable seating! If you need to get some work done, there's a nice little cafeteria area literally right outside the coffee corner and it's not too noisy but you can get easily distracted if you're a dog lover like me. Which one of the Basements best qualities, dog friendly!

hME-y8rH5MUc-vpN2kZPKg,5,"When I heard The Franklin was reopening I was so excited.  I had hoped it was as good as I remembered.  It wasn't... IT WAS EVEN BETTER!  


Each dish we had tickled my culinary imagination and opened new doors of spices and flavors.  


The food: We ordered a dozen raw oysters, beef tartare, and succotash.

Raw oysters with cucumber mignonette,fresh horseradish, and saltines. I never thought I would be putting cucumber anything on my raw oysters! OMG IT IS SO GOOD AND REFRESHING.  Seriously, if you like [or love] raw oysters you HAVE to check out The Franklin and have these. You will not be disappointed.

Beef Tartare.  Our waiter recommended this dish and I am so glad he did.  The tartare has pho garnishes mixed in and is served with a flaky, crispy puff.  Even though the server told us it did indeed have a familiar pho taste, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Sure enough it tasted like the sexy, delicious child of the world's best pho and beef tartare. Just a beautiful symphony/rave of flavors. 

 Spaetzle  Truly I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this dish.  I was delightfully impressed.  The dish consists of simply succotash and Parmesan. It had just the right amount of cheese and warmth. 


The environment  I will  just go ahead and say it. The Franklin is sexy.  Dim lit. Warm, relaxing colors. They have beautiful art including a large piece by Alyssa Monk (people submerged in water=sexy) and  a person in a full body cheetah print suit on a couch, gives it a touch of BDSM feel (again, sexy). The ceiling is tufted, reminding me of a clean, sultry bedroom.  *Puurrrr*

Exceeded all my expectations and desires. Literally the best Indian ever. So happy it's only an 8 min walk away. How have we not discovered lazeez yet.... This is dangerous. I'll be back soon lol.

Well packaged and came home hot. Perfect. Fair pricing too for the city. And the quality was just too notch. There's only one other place who makes their sauce this creamy and delicious and it's a place we found in Pittsburgh years ago.

djxnI8Ux8ZYQJhiOQkrRhA,5,"Wow! Katie's, where have you been all my life? 

Actually, that's not completely true. I've eaten at Katie's before, but it was several years ago, right when they first opened up. I wasn't terribly impressed (back then my idea of ""good"" pizza was pepperoni and maybe olives) and didn't think to come back until just recently. 

Fast forward to Wednesday night. My gal pals and I just finished up a pedicure at Beautiful Nail and I used the handy Yelp iPhone app to find restaurants nearby. Katie's popped up and I remembered reading so many positive reviews about it, so why not give it another try?

I had completely forgotten how cute it is inside! The interior reminds me of someplace you'd visit that's not St. Louis... perhaps Chicago or LA. Some previous reviews mentioned bad service, but our waitress was awesome. She gave us plenty of time to pick out what we wanted to eat and even suggested a bottle of Chianti that would go well with our selection. 

Let me just say that their salads are to die for. Even if you're not a pizza lover, go here and order one of their many delicious leafy green options. One salad can easily be split between two people as an appetizer. We went for the beet salad, which had some of the best dressing I've had in a long time. 

For the main course, two of us split the roasted chicken pizza and my other friend had the four cheese pie. Both had a thin, crispy crust with fresh, hot ingredients on top. Hit the spot in so many ways! That was a lot of food for only three people, but we managed to eat almost everything served to us. 

I'm happy that Katie's was one of my last meals in STL - it was a perfect evening with my best friends. Glad that I have 'em another shot and that they blew it out of the park.",2010-12-24 16:14:05

2uzH6U_kGVOBIIJoZOOUPw,4,"I'm in love with the BBQ sliders (brisket, pork and chicken). They're moist and juicy and I just want to stuff my face with them every day, for every meal.

The dry-rub wings are tasty, too. They're $5 bucks at happy hour, and though you only get about five or six wings, they're not too skimpy. Plus, they taste the way I always want my chicken on the grill to taste--crispy, almost a little burnt, with a nice charred flavor and tender on the inside. While I fail at cooking (er, grilling), Betty's does not.

The sauce (Sam's Famous BBQ) used on the BBQ combo platter (1/4 chicken and 1/4 ribs) is sweet and tangy and so wonderfully finger-lickin' good. I'm definitely a fan of having to lick my fingers a million times after each bite of messy BBQ. Wet wipes are available, of course, but who wants to waste any last drop of sauce, even if it means lick-lick-licking away?

The macaroni salad is decent and the mac and cheese is oozy with a little bit of breadcrumb crunch on top. Both are worthy of thumbs up. The stuffing with gravy is just okay ... there was a flavor in there I couldn't quite pick out and I probably wouldn't order it again. And the buttermilk biscuit was quite dry. It tasted like someone went overboard with the flour and forgot about the butter. But! The rest of the menu looks promising (lots of interesting sandwiches and plenty of other sides). Must try more!

I wasn't drinking yesterday (huh?!) but the beer/wine/cocktail menu was similar to that of Devil's Alley--plentiful enough for drinkers across the board. The Smokin' Betty's Blonde and house wines were being offered for $3 during happy hour. I'm sure I'll be hittin' that up next time.

Oh, and I loved dining upstairs by the windows. Actually, the whole space is quite swank but in a non-glitzy way. Dark wood and lots of light. I could see it being a great spot for an event. Plus, the service (both hostess and servers) was friendly and attentive. Let's see if that sticks.

Yay and more yay! I hope this place does well because I'm looking forward to getting my BBQ on a lot more often this summer.

b39y_inQloddW6I49gV5AA,3,"Fergie's is a fine spot for some beers and grub, but on the pricey side.

The beer selection is okay with about half a dozen draft beers and about a couple of dozen bottled beers, including a few impressive hard-to-find brews.

The food is fine. The chilis, both meat and veggie, used to be standouts, but then they changed the cornbread recipe, and the dish didn't have the same kick.  Maybe they're rectified that; chefs change here so you never know.

On Tuesday and Thursday nights there' s quizo here, which is great.  Except for the $10 a person minimum charge since not everyone always wants to drink booze or eat on quizo nights.

On some nights they have live bands perform upstairs.  The music tends to be amplified to deafening levels.  Earplugs are great if you have them.

I took the van to the Conicelli Toyota in Springfield, PA. I was presented with a $1500 estimate to replace the door motor and apparatus and I was charged $128 for the service of looking for the problem.  I decided to try and get another estimate as that seemed quite high. As a result of looking into the situation with other people I purchased the cable part directly from a parts company. A friend believed he could replace the part. Although I received the part in December it wasn't until recently that he was able to do the job due to the weather. As a result it was just the cable apparatus that was needed not the motor. The cable apparatus cost $36.63. I feel that Conicelli Toyota was either trying to rip me off big time or they didn't want to be bothered with a small job of replacing the cable apparatus. Either way it says nothing good about this Toyota service location. As a result I will never go back there.

EwY-4k2CKxc6Z8-W7SlIcg,1,"Last year I went into this dealership to purchase my first vehicle. I ended up buying a Jeep Cherokee and although I loved the car, I've regretted going to this dealership. I wish I had looked around more at the time and been more cautious because I without a doubt know I paid too much for it. A couple of days later, my sister decided to trade in her Jeep Wrangler, for another one. I liked our sales person, and everything seemed like it was going fine. 

We both purchased the extended warranty on our cars, and we've both had immense issues with customer service. We were both supposedly given free oil changes for 5 years when we purchased the cars, but when my sister went into get hers, she apparently didn't have the sheets for it. They said they couldn't do anything for her because it could've been the case that she had ""either never been given free oil changes or had sold them to make some money."" Absolutely ridiculous! They had no other way to pull up her information to see what was going on! I would think that a dealership of this size would have a better way of documenting these sorts of things to ensure that customers were covered should there be any sort of issue. She was denied the service, that she had been promised.

I figured that I would have better luck since I found the oil change sheets in a folder I had received when I purchased my car. However, I also had issues with their service! Every time I booked an appointment either to do an oil change or fix a flat tire, they needed something different! Every person I talked to told me something different. I needed the sheet for the oil change, then I needed all the sheets for oil changes I had. For the first flat tire I had I didn't need to provide any paperwork to demonstrate that I had purchased an extended warranty, but then the second time, they wanted to charge me, and refused to look up my information on the computer (which another representative had previously told me was possible)

This month, my car was stolen, and my insurance recommended I contact the dealership to receive some of the money that I had put towards this warranty, that I won't get to use, and I've been completely tossed around. I've tried to get in contact with multiple people, but have yet to hear back. 

My experience was so bad, that now that I am in the market for another vehicle, I am avoiding this dealership, and have decided to avoid Jeep all together! 

Overall, this dealership has some of the worst customer service I have ever come across. Avoid at all costs!",2015-08-17 18:36:40
u5o_QDwRPQW8gjgFudu9bg,5,"Man, I really lucked out with this trail.  I was on a group camping trip up the road at Lake Cachuma and had this trail scheduled.  They told us it was a 6 mile hike and about 30 minutes into the drive over there I was already ready to go home. lol.  I am not a hiker and it was really hot so I was nervous about being able to hang, and the fact that I was at the mercy of other people was making me sweat.  

Luckily, the swimming hole we found at the end of about a half mile of ""hiking"" was perfect and the group went swimming and after an hour or so they were ready to go back.  If I can make it out here again, I will try to hike the rest of the trail and find the other swimming holes.  

Be prepared for the $10 fee to get into the park.  There will be a person there to collect it and give you a tag.  This spot is not run by the forest service, so the person is not official looking. There are several river crossings you have to pass just to get to the trail head, which can be driven through in a sedan, but probably better if you have a bigger car.  It's about 5 miles in from the point you pay and it is seriously beautiful.  Be careful, look for other cars and don't get distracted by the view, but do enjoy it!

As a big group, we got many, many rolls. Every one was delicious and different. My favorite was the Mt. Lemon roll (I love lemon slices on sushi) and this one had no rice - just a big ol' bite of crab, lemon and other flavors. The Geisha lips and Golden Lobster were  also very flavorful. The Paris Roll was the most far-out for me, but I loved the variety of smoked salmon, kiwi and and spice. 

I also had a few bites of my sister's Tepan combo w/ filet mignon and lobster with chow mein type noodles - needless to say a very classy sort of fusion dish that was well cooked on both the surf and turf.

Long review: Tacos are probably my favorite food group and this place does not just serve yummy tacos, but they are beautiful tacos with flavors that you never expected to taste.  The pickled red onion with a hint of clove was delish.  The ever so subtle cinnamon hiding here and there was such a nice surprise.  My taste buds just wanted to get up and dance!

Piggy Stardust , perfect.  It was beautiful, tasty and the mango habanero sauce was a yummy option. 

I wanted to try more of their beautiful food,  but the tacos come in pairs (psst , how about letting us put two different tacos on a plate ? It would be a heavenly option) so I guess, I will just have to come back another day. 

The space is cozy,  hip and has great local artwork on the walls.  Bruce Maurey's portraits of some of my most beloved musicians hang downstairs and the mural that leads to the upstairs is the handiwork of Cody Rutty.  A live jazz band was being offered on a Monday evening!  Who does that ?  

This place is Boise through and through; casual setting with indoor and outdoor seating options to enjoy great food, art and music; all of it , first rate.

Okay let's begin: I got a half chicken (buttermilk ranch) and two sticky bun donuts to share  with my boyfriend. The half chicken was $9.25 and it was four pieces. I was hoping one would be a wing (it was not). there was one small breast, two thighs and a drumstick. I consider this price to be very very expensive. I don't like the fact that you can't just order pieces of chicken. It's in halves and wholes only. I understand the whole ""more sustainable, more humane"" thing of not ordering multiple wings, but I would be more inclined to come here a lot if it wasn't a $14 brunch. I got the half to share and honestly, I could have eaten three pieces because they were on the smaller end.

Mo Pitney, who I had not heard of, was awesome.  I have already added some of his music.

We had great seats, right down on the floor by the stage.  All seats had a good view, and the sound system was good.

One of the servers forgot my coffee. No big deal. When he came back he gave us one. We quickly ordered and it took a little bit more than normal. When I got our food I ordered the infamous egg couchon. My one egg was already broken.. Which was the severs fault when bringing it back (usually) kinda annoyed. The yolk was pretty dry by the time it got to me is all. However, I checked in and got the cheaper Bacon Bloody Mary. that was fabulous. Would I come here again? I'm not sure, but it was a great experience and I'm Glad we went once. Love the history behind the place. Oh yeah.. My sister got the cheesecake stuffed French toast!

ZDCWEctaQHfJQT1sH_rMmA,5,"As a Santa Barbara local, I'm happy to have tried this place out for the first time today. Better late than never!

This restaurant is located in a great part of downtown Santa Barbara. It's in the heart of town, just off State Street but still close enough to be near all the action. 

The place is large and very clean. It's decorated well and is quite appealing with its fresh pre-prepared salads on display. There isn't a traditional posted menu, per se, but the counter staff were great about helping my first-time self navigate through the process. 

I ended up ordering their pastrami sandwich (coincidentally, they are located next door to Norton's Pastrami which is the most prominent of its kind in town), along with a side order of their pesto green beans. The pastrami held its own and was prepared very well. The green beans were great as well. I never would have thought to pair pesto with legumes but the combination worked well!
 
This is a great lunch place and I will be back!",2021-09-28 04:05:18

H8uJFxNes8YCyk5NWyZNsw,5,"What a gorgeous property! Everywhere I looked at, every corner I saw, was full of beauty and class. It feels like home yet strange enough I feel like I'm in the south of Spain or the Amalfi coast in Italy. 

I've traveled to many beautiful places but I find this to be one of the most peaceful yet enchanting properties poised with magnificence and romance. 

There is not one flaw that I came across. The property is clean, well taken care of, landscaped with lush green vegetation, and neatly furnished with beautiful Spanish style tiles and orange bricks that make you feel like you're somewhere in an exotic land. 

I feel at peace here and it is just about 20-30 steps to the beach. It's so gorgeous. 

So far the food has also been impeccable and so different from any other establishments (hotels) that serve food. Everyone has a smile on their faces and you can tell they love their jobs. 

The room is huge and has got all the amenities. The only flaw which I won't take stars down for is the broken Nespresso machine that did not work but was provided free of charge. Also all laid out on the table and inside the drawer, were food that you'd be charged for had you opened the box. I obviously know that but usually there is a note stating that, and in that case there was not. This makes no sense, but I was only there for a night and i wasn't going to eat the candy anyways. My only issue was the broken Nespresso machine :(

Anyways I simply love it here and it's worth every penny for this priceless view and experience. I hope to be back one day",2019-11-22 17:15:14

YX2-_LZdzXhU1Q1qdXG8nA,1,"Horrendous experience. Avoid at all costs. I'm one of the unlucky ones who's mother insists on my brother and I taking these pics EVERY YEAR, so I think 32 years if these qualifies me to say this is the WORST company to ever get pictures through. We went to Westgate in Saratoga, CA on 12/8/21

1) Santa insisted we grown adults sit on his lap which as grown adults, is just awkward, uncomfortable and unnecessary 

2) The photographer was deep into his phone, texting away at something and leaving my brother and I to sit on Santa's knees for longer than necessary. Despite us and Santa saying ""hello!"" ""Hi could you take the picture?"" And ""Excuse me?"" several times, we could get his attention and he moved behind the monitor on the desk to continue texting ""out of sight.""

3) Once we took the pictures we had no choice in identifying 1) which pictures we wanted or 2) which package we wanted. So they printed whichever pose they wanted in whichever size they wanted and proceeded to print out the largest most expensive package with the explicit intention of throwing out the ones we don't buy. What a waste of resources AND extra waste all that is completely avoidable. And WHAT!? Why can't we pick the best picture to be printed in the size we want??

4) the ONLY options to purchase your pictures are what's pictured. So as someone who's done this for decades and only wants one 5""x7"" to add to the many other 5""x7"" Santa pics on her mother's wall. This is absurd. 

I STRONGLY do NOT recommend using these services ever again. I'd rather pay someone $40 to sit in a Santa suit and take a singular picture next year and moving forward. Don't waste your time or money here.",2021-12-09 17:38:49

Don't know what I was expecting here. I ordered the General Tso chicken with crab Rangoons. Now, the crab Rangoons were fine. I mean, they were not mind blowing but I was satisfied. 

The General Tso chicken was okay. The sauce is extremely sweet (which I'm not the biggest fan of) but it was spiced nicely. A lot of Chinese places I've eaten from make this big disclaimer about their General Tso chicken having a kick to it. Theirs SORT of hit the mark. Also glad they don't use that breading that makes the chicken look like large ginger root. Yuck. There is some breading on the chicken though. 

Okay, so now we are down one star based on the above...

The RIIIIIIIIIICE is why they're down two more. I hate to be harsh but it tasted like burned Uncle Ben's 5-minute vegetable rice. I typically love Chinese (and other Asian rice dishes) but that was a disservice. I really feel like the rice was either scorched or severely over cooked. It was not pleasant at all.

jcaPJQg3oXDB4BcLmasiAA,2,".

I usually use a Flowbee for my son's haircuts, and put the $15 we save with each cut into his college account, because it's so easy to do it at home, does a great job, saves gas and time, and it's FREE! 

About 5 weeks ago, my husband decides to take our son for a ""professional"" haircut. One of only 4 he's ever had at a ""salon"". Each time, they have come home regretting it... with a cut worse than anything our Flowbee can accomplish. 

This time was the worst! Even though my husband informed April (the stylist) about our son's congenital triangular alopecia (a small bald spot on one side), she was not paying attention (she was apparently trying to train a new stylist across the room) and cut his hair WAY too short, exposing the bald spot. For the past few weeks, we have had to color in his little bald spot with a Sharpie marker, and 5 weeks later, his hair still has not grown long enough to cover it. Granted, they did not charge for the cut (thus the 2 stars instead of one), and my husband did not tip, he was so mad. But the poor kid is a teenager, and image is extra important at his age. Seriously, stylists, please pay attention! I'm sure you would not want to walk around all self-conscious, being stared at and talked about by your peers, yet this is what our son has had to live with for the past several weeks. 

I usually try to avoid negative reviews, and like to give out more positive ones, but I also think that we should all give our very best to the customers we serve, and to give them our undivided attention. I have thought about this for weeks, and have decided that this should be addressed. Everyone makes mistakes, but the area was shown, specific instructions given, including which blade size to use just prior to the cut, so no excuse! Just pay attention!

Off to order new Flowbee blades....",2015-11-13 00:45:49

-ZHlPAvlVdgtiu6DiCq7Yg,5,"No frills, low dollar bills.  That's their slogan, right?  Well if not, it SHOULD be.  Only one or two registers open at any given time, but their cashiers are the fastest this side of the Pecos and can clear a huge line in no time flat.  The products (especially staple items like cheese and milk) are so much cheaper than other supermarkets.  An example is calcium added OJ.  The cheapest I have found it elsewhere (on sale) is around $2.00.  Here, it is $1.69 all the time.  

If you haven't been in a while, it's time to go back.  Their produce used to be limited and half rotten. Now it is fresh and there's a good selection.  Their cheese are no longer limited to cheddar and American -- they have Swiss, blue, feta, cream cheese, Mexican style, just to name a few.  

Make sure to hit their random stuff aisle, where you might find kids toys, kitchen equipment, and gym bags.  You just never know what you will find.

If you haven't been here before, they save money by carrying only their own generic brands, not advertising, not providing bags or baggers, and not having cart collectors.  This means the following for you:
- bring a quarter if you want to rent a shopping cart, and be sure to return it to get your quarter back
- bring your own grocery bags or plan to pay to buy them there (or snag a cardboard box as you are shopping)
- be ready to bag your own groceries on the ledge after cashing out (just like the Germans! Don't you feel exotic?)",2015-01-28 00:03:56

B5s_DCLVrBLrL8U6TEVlwA,3,"Bottom Line:  Over all, the food has improved but the value hasn't

This place has definitely gone through some evolution since it has been opened.   The quality of the food has improved which is great because at $14, that hamburger had better be amazing.

Their burgers have come a long way since open.  I dont mind paying for burgers here as clearly some time has gone into them and they are delicious....$30 for two hamburgers is hard to get past sometimes though.

Wife and I went last night on a whim and just to switch it up I ordered a Caesar salad and a side of onion rings.  

I have to be totally honest here - the Caesar Salad looked like it was one of those pre-made ones in the airport for $11, but it was in a restaurant for $11 (well, $10.25).

It was literally just a bowl of romaine with some Parmesan strips.  If I'm totally honest, it was sad. 

If it was $6 that would be one thing but I believe that a lot of people would agree with me that if it's something you could make at home in three minutes, it shouldn't cost $10.

We tried another shake and got this big one this time which was much better than the tiny one.

When all was said and done, the bill was about $36-$38 for a burger, salad, side of onion rings, fries and a milkshake, before tip.  Since the service is always good we like to tip 20%, so now we are flirting with $50 for burger lunch....

Due to Covid they are serving coffee table side along with refills and I really appreciate this... ie not having to interrupt my meeting or conversation abruptly to walk to the self service coffee station.  
The food is spectacular. There are many creative options to try as well as the frittata skillets which are usually my go to. There are many very strong brunch spots in the area and this has emerged as my favorite. Highly recommend.",2021-03-02 05:27:05
3LBfzNMGRFKB_YKd1CiWCw,5,"Fresh water hobbyist turned saltwater aficionado, who was looking for a local store able to help with equipment, setup, and livestock. This was the place!!!  

We walked in and we're treated by a staff eager to help and not up sell to make a quick buck. They set us up with a nice tank and guided us through the start up process. I tried to add items I thought were necessary (don't believe everything you read online) and was saved big bucks by the knowledgeable staff. Prices were very comparable to online and they even sold us some items at cost since we bought a complete setup. 

The store just feels nice, clean, and inviting. They do get busy, so expect to wait if you are looking for specific things. Take this time to marvel at their tanks and imagine what you could one day set up in your own home. 

It's a 45 minute drive for me and the family, but it's worth every minutes. One the weekends, I ask my son what he wants to do and the answer is always, ""Visit Seascape!""  I'm a customer for as long as I keep saltwater and recommend you give this place a try and let them prove they are the best is the STL area. Thanks Seascape!",2017-02-20 16:03:47

I had to wait 40 minutes after I dropped my car  before they even touched it. This was mostly due to the extreme laziness with which the staff was moving. One out of the 10 people working was hustling. The girl wiping my car down did the most lazy job I've ever seen. A spritz of something and what is best described as an air wash. 

The guy that was hustling next to my car finished 4 cars in the time it took her to vacuum my car. The staff in general looked leaderless and lost. They frequently circled up to discuss lord knows what and slowed down the process even more. What a complete waste. 

I feel like the manager needs to take away their cell phones.

kmo2-gxJkZjsTDOMXONjRQ,5,This place was my absolute favorite spot before I had kids and when I lived over this direction. I came here all the time when I lived at my condo off old Virginia st. It's a small family owned business. I never would get eggs Benedict anywhere because I always knew I could make it better but I tried theirs and it was pretty amazing. I noticed now they microwave their poached eggs now which is a bummer but I get it I guess. I got their chicken fried steak and it was perfectly crispy and full of meat. The gravy was pretty amazing also. Their chilaquiles was spicy and perfectly cooked. Crunchy but soft also. Great flavors.,2021-06-09 14:16:48

Update
Sadly the Curtis response was not dissimilar in fashion, to what others are reporting

Curtis was not at all interested in their lack of service
Unable to hear any criticism and absolute in their unwillingness to learn
Though very interested in berating me
Wow! Simply no comprehension of customer service

Cheryl Curtis just rambled on about numerous topics
ie; 
Number of incoming phone lines, business structure...
Really Cheryl? 
To your customer these details are of no relevance
Seemingly it was anything she could come up with to obfuscate my issues
It went so far as;
Cheryl weaving a tale that I was contacted, by her no less
I was never contacted, remember this is what started my epic adventure
I am told internally Curtis did contact themselves, well that's swell
Cheryl bested her own incompetence by:
Telling me I was lying about the conversation between her employee and myself. 
Oddly this is was a conversation Cheryl was not privy to
Though she did remain absolute in her knowledge of its contents
note Cheryl never asked this employee what transpired
The conversation was regarding the following days schedule and what would transpire.

Oy Vey, in all Curtis has gone done the drain

The Internets yielded some great corollaries to my own experience:

Zee2O3kDiBwJyHN2a33uhA,1,"Well I have had trouble with their billing dept for MANY YEARS.  It seems by the comments here, A LOT of other patients have as well!   I just received a bill for my co pay, and I had paid it 7 weeks ago when I was in there.  I called and they said they do have me paying it......then why send me a bill??              BUT they said that I have a bill in COLLECTIONS for a bit over $130 !!!!!!!!!!!  I can only assume that this is from 2014-2018 when they double billed me and refused to honor their contract with my ins co by accepting what the ins paid with my co pay.  They actually tried to get me to pay the difference that my ins didn't pay!  The ins co told me they CANNOT do that to a patient since they have a contract with them.    PH has to accept what the ins co pays them along with my co pay...and that is it!   Then pima (have no) heart double billed me.  They also billed me for an appt where the doctor didn't show and I was told he was stuck in the hospital (he wasn't...he told me he was home sick)   They knew yet they didn't call me to cancel the appt and I had to drive 45 min one way to get there.   
SERIOUSLY.....how in the world can I trust a company (which is what PH is) when their billing is so unethical and illegal in their practices?????   Even my doctor there said they push too much and give him too many patients to rush thru.  What should be a 20-25 min appt is in reality only 5 to 7 minutes!!   How accurate can a doctor be in that short period of time?? Especially when dealing with YOUR HEART???    My last appt a couple months ago was rushed thru...The doctor left the room before I had a chance to finish asking my questions!!!   I had thought he was coming back...never did.  He was only there 4 minutes.  My trust in this place to care for my heart issues is totally gone.

sbVPOGXCoU87oT8zI5pw9Q,3,"Having been a member since the day it opened, I'll give my honest assessment:

I feel like the value of my membership is easily earned by the free classes they offer as well as the overall quality of the equipment, the facility and the pool.  Considering I dont even use the basketball, squash, yoga or pilates, I think there is something for everyone here - to an extent.  

What is not so great about it is the HARD and i mean HARD selling that goes on among the trainers there.  When my wife joined, she looked for someone to just take 30 minutes to show her the equipment on the main gym floor.  2 minutes later, the trainer was trying to talk her into a $190+ dollar package for monthly training and how they don't really do one-off sessions.  It is like the $90-$120 you pay per month just kind of gets you in the door and there's little help beyond that.

I also have a couple of friends locally that have heard me rave about the gym but I cant seem to get them in because the guest-passes are prohibitive. I get why they dont want people inviting herds of guests into the pool at summertime but this place would not lose money by letting me take a co-worker before 4pm to one of the morning classes that I take.  

Also, the LT Bucks are an absolute joke.  They were sold to us as being able to be used anywhere and after learning we cant use them in the Cafe (no big deal) we tried to sign up for a group class and turns out they aren't dollar-for-dollar.  So we wanted to use some of our LT bucks to shave off the price of a monthly premium class and apparently the LT Bucks only get you a free week of the class, so you get 5 weeks for the price of 4, not 4 weeks for a reduced price.  You are also locked into 2 months the moment you sign up for a class since each class requires 30-day notice to cancel.  Navigating the frustrating add-on services and the complete joke of a program known as LT Bucks is daunting. It is easily my least favorite part of the Gym.  I'm not a picky individual and trust me, it is a pain.

If you have some background in fitness and can make the most out of what is there, the gym is great - and there's a ton to offer.",2017-10-03 19:54:59

You can't go without having the brisket. But the fried chicken is so crispy you will regret not getting it. And the ribs. They are fall off the bone ....  ok so they have a meat sampler but don't forget the sides. Not only do you need some veg like your mama said but they are delicious!

The door was locked upon arrival, as I walked away the owner Pie came out to greet us and explain the restaurant is not open so there's only outside dining.  After being seated my daughter and I requested water with lemon. There were no other patrons there yet it took a while to receive it.  We ordered an appetizer and sushi to enjoy along with the Yelp Elite Entree.  I enjoyed the stuffed jalapeños but the sushi was warm and not rolled tight.  We then waited an hour for the fish tacos!  They were a disappointment because they came out cold and dry!  Additionally, the menu should state its Tilapia.  I don't eat this type of fish, therefore I did not eat it.  My daughter ate a bite of hers and agreed it was not good at all.  The owner/manager was the only person taking care of everything.  Although there were only four tables she appeared overwhelmed.  Three different parties came and left due to the slow service.  I asked to use the restroom.  She stated sure but give me a few minutes.  When granted access i could see the restaurant is no where near completion, there's stuff everywhere piled up!  The bathroom had no a/c do it was stuffy and the trash was filled so clearly it needed attention.  I'm total were were there around 1/2 hours and left as soon as the tacos arrived.

I've been in luxury sales and have a clear understanding of the sales process from lead generation to closing and could write a book on all the propoganda tools  used in the process to direct your customer to a close.  I advised my salesperson (still new) that I was not a big fan of pointless repeated contacts and that if I wanted the vehicle after checking it out, that I would buy it.  Plain and simple.   All went well, I bought it.   1 month later and I've received no less than 10 followups from the dealership in the form of phone calls from my salesperson asking about referrals and hoping my vehicle is everything I wanted.  Mileage requests for extended warranty qualification, service work coupon mailers,  requests for reviews of my experience and to rate the followups.  I even get a phone call from my salesperson thanking me for my business and asking for referrals AGAIN- when just hours earlier I received a recall notice (salesman obviously oblivious to this because he doesn't even mention it).  

Yes, I agree it is important to follow up with customers.  But your number of soliciatations rivals those of Charter Spectrum.  If I need your services, I know where you are.

We consider ourselves very loyal to local businesses and ALWAYS give businesses the opportunity to correct issues. I HAVE NEVER VOCALIZED THIS EXTENSIVE OF AN ISSUE WITH ANY BUSINJESS BEFORE.

Since ""VCA"" appeared in their name, the quality of service and cost of treatment at Baring has reacted inversely and proportional. The first has sunk into a pit and the second has skyrocketed.

HdOr1TRuBz2svboJUUlmIA,5,"I meant to write a review every time I have eaten here, but, my mind floats away on a cloud of fragrant steam for a week or two ... I forget .. and, then I go back and it happens all over again. 

I love this place. I love the decor. I love the ... manager, I guess he is, who is personable, funny and a little weird. I love the server, who is also personable, funny and, a little weird. I hope if they read this, they recognize it as the compliment I mean it to be. 

I love the lo mein. Sometimes, I want to try the fried rice, but, then, I wouldn't have the lo mein! That just would not be correct! But, I did have a lunch special, once, wherein I had to have steamed rice and I enjoyed that, too. 

I have had the sesame chicken twice, a taste of orange chicken once,  broccoli beef once, a taste of Spicy Tofu once, Teriyaki chicken once, Thom Ka chicken (I think I spelled that right) once, and,  Ginger Tofu only the once. The Teriyaki chicken suffered by comparison to the other dishes, but, was pretty good compared to other things I had from other places. 

I have been told their drunken noodles and margaritas are fabulous, but, have no personal experience. I do like their unsweetened tea, which is nice and strong, but, not too strong. 

I love their egg drop soup and hot and sour soup. 

The lunch prices are lovely. 

Oh, and, I forgot: I had some spicy won tons once and their spring rolls, as part of a meal, twice, and, a little of one of their more expensive dishes that had shrimp and squid (and, maybe, also chicken). 

The Teriyaki chicken was good. Everything else was even better. Their lo mein makes me wonder why I waste my time eating other things, until I bite into the other things.",2018-08-02 18:45:25

We tried spicy pork tacos, carne Asada tacos, and a beef burrito (also packed with rice and beans, cream and lettuce). 

Everything was hot, fresh, served quickly, and more than adequate sized for the small prices! The tacos are small, but only a dollar, so get a few of them! The burrito, for just $5 was massive (comparable to chipotle size). Very pleased with taste, value, and service. We'll return when in the area again!!",2016-09-16 23:56:05

The service had been so appalling that we activing encouraged others to avoid, but we really want to like them so we gave them one last try.  Service was pretty good, we were greeted when we walked in and actually discussed the beer while we waited to be seated.  Our waitress quickly arrived after being seated and we order our beers, the doppelbock was outstanding.  The cheesy load was so so.  The bread was good, but the bread to cheese ratio was off.  There needs to be less bread or more cheese.  We ordered fish tacos, which were huge and loaded with fish and avocado. And the wild horse sausage, beer name not meat.  Quite tasty!  It was Friday night so it got super busy and we lost sight of our waitress.  If we could of located her earlier, we would of definitely had the wassail as the tasted was Christmas in a glass, but were on a schedule.  I'm glad I was able to talk my wife into trying again.

Thank-you's were given every time she dropped something off.  She wasn't rude and we had no complaints until we received the check.  The two drinks that were included in the Groupon were included.   I nicely informed her that we came in on a Groupon. She snatched the receipt from me and walked away.  I understand that she may have forgotten as she could've been in the weeds and it was the end of the show so everyone wanted to pay and leave, but there was no reason for the attitude. She brought back the receipt and this time it did NOT include the itemize receipt with the credit card receipt. The total was over $7 what it should've been.  It was a 50% tip! There was no point in calling a manger over and arguing with such an unscrupulous human being.  I have one Groupon left and I will NOT use it after this experience.",2014-10-28 16:08:54

FdH_3gnLR7vW_2ZmLAejiw,5,"I came to Biscuit Love, solo, ambitious, and determined to finally tackle the line and judge the hype once and for all. 

After waiting about ~40 minutes outside, I put my mask on, enter the doors, and start checking out the merch.

Then suddenly, as my body usually and conveniently likes to do in social situations in foreign areas, I start to feel extremely light headed. My vision is slowly blurring and I can no longer hear the hustle and bustle of biscuits being ordered and brown sugar lemonades being poured. 

Next thing I know, I sway towards the windows and three ladies in front of me are holding me by my arms as my knees are almost touching the ground. A BL employee runs to get me a chair, cup of orange juice, and a wet towel. 

Within minutes, my vision and hearing returns and people are asking me if I am diabetic and offering me donuts. I reply that this ""happens all the time"" but in addition I am 4 months pregnant so it could be a combo of factors. The same BL employee from earlier gets me a seat at the bar and ensures I am okay. I finally feel normal again and able to place my order of biscuit and sausage gravy and bonuts to go. 

My food came out quickly and when I hand over my card she says, ""it's on house."" Not only was I cured by biscuits, but my fainting, pregnant, southern California ass was given the infamous and utmost ~southern hospitality~!!! 

I was too disheveled to get this woman's name, but she was wearing a backwards hat. If you are reading this or know who I am talking about, please send me her name and give her a shoutout, raise, and the world for being such a genuine caretaker. I am incredibly and infinitely thankful!

Iu6bkhCmMyHwJboJdxLw5g,1,"I got a good deal on the vehicle I purchased, every Vehicle is sold ""As-Is"". The Carfax was clean. But 4 days after I bought it, I noticed the parking sensors System was shut off. I turned it on and warning bells & whistles that the vehicle needed to go to the dealership. The dealership told me the rear bumper was removed and therefore voided the warranty because there was obviously work done but not by a certified dealership. But NBD, that's my fault, I should have made sure that everything worked before I put pen to paper. The GPS SD was missing but the owner said to me (before I bought it) that one was ordered from the dealership and it was no problem. So I got the GPS card from them and installed it. DID NOT WORK! The dealership said the card SD card is married to the system and if you try to remove one from another car it will not work. I called Discovery and explained that there was an issue. I was told it's not their fault they had no idea there was work done the bumper(yea ok), I seen ur guys out back taking cars apart, so that's a lie! I at least wanted them to reimburse me the costs of fixing the GPS that also controlled other features.  Well my salesman said the card was bought from EBay (after the owner said it was ordered from the dealership) and if I wanted to, I could try to recoup by selling a SD (that is completely worthless) to someone else. Yea I'm not that kind of scum bag...Wow! Well, I love the vehicle so that's a great thing but there's one thing for sure...they will NEVER get my Biz again & I'll be sure to tell ALL of my Military Vet friends to steer clear. They have NO integrity, not transparent at all and once you sign the ppwk, they could care less about you & ANY issues you may have  The only part of the process that was good was the financing, our guy was AWESOME!  So if your reading this...look at the other reviews, the owner comments on great reviews but not bad ones. Maybe not because you can't please every customer, but more of they don't GAF about you once they sold u the vehicle. Take this as a warning, this dealership is not bad but they are NOT honest brokers for damn sure. Take your hard earned $ else where or you might be sorry you didn't.",2020-02-28 16:55:43

So, after being disappointed with his bike that he bought on the internet about a year ago which broke almost immediately, he started researching bikes with close to 5 stars online.  We went to a place in Hammond near his college and had a bad experience with Gray Cat cycles.  We decided to look at bike shops either in or near the New Orleans area. We went to one bike shop Bayou bikes or something like that and my son told the lady there what he was looking for and actually she told us to check out Dashing.  She said that they moved to a new location so I called to make sure of the address.  The man who answered the phone was so polite and told me the address and we went there and was actually greeted outside the door because I told him that I couldn't  find the building but knew I had to be nearby. He helped my son right away.  My son purchased a Retrospect Harper in a matte olive green.  He purchased a kick stand which was installed there in the shop.  The bike totaled about $340.00 with the kickstand.  It is the bike of his dreams, and loves riding it.  It will be used mostly to get around the college campus.  I was so impressed as how knowledgeable and caring the staff was that I brought my bike to the store to purchase 2 new tires and to get a little tune up on it.  I was told that it may take around a few days to get it back or a week.  I got a call a couple of hours later that my bike was ready!!!!! People truly do make a difference.

The front staff has been nothing short of amazing. I was having trouble booking and they assisted me, helping me to create a schedule that works for me. I have also gone through some medical issues and personal trauma that required a last minute cancellations, and they worked with me to sort it out. Special shout-out to my girls Kim and Molly and my guys Rasheed and John. 

The coaches, particularly Katie and Sally because their class times are the ones I can make, are amazing. I always feel supported, seen, and also challenged. It has helped me see tremendous growth in strength, speed, and other non-scale victories.

Now more than 40 years later it has grown to more than 60 pavilions representing 85 different cultures. This is always a great opportunity to try food you have never tried or even heard of. You can also learn a lot about each culture at their pavilion. Buy some of their cultural items and experience some of their entertainment.

The site for this festival is Hawrelak Park and it is so huge it pretty much takes up the entire park so be prepared for lots of walking. It seems like this weekend is also usually one of the hottest weekends of the year so make sure you bring water or be prepared to buy on site for a bit of a premium.

This is also one of the biggest food raisers for the Edmonton Food Bank. If the weather is bad and the crowds stay away then it can impact that organization quite negatively. So make sure you bring a good donation for the Food Bank too!

iAQp8LT5jCLz43bv2X6oFw,5,"First, go here to eat the best thing they make, pizza by the slice with maximum of one topping. Some people don't get this, I didn't the first time, but it's the real deal. The cracker thin crust is amazing, sauce specifically prepared for this type of pizza and just the right amount of cheese. I'm a fan of everything else on the menu, especially the nice salad, but pizza by the slice is the best thing on the menu. They also have RC COLA and Dr pepper in the fountain, which I love.

 Don't expect this to be pizza hut or your typical grocery store pizza. Those that do, don't get this place and should go eat somewhere else. The owner doesn't care and neither should you. Order a slice, drink your beer and go home full and happy.",2016-06-02 20:11:06

I came here on a Saturday morning at around 730am, so I didn't think they would run out of donuts since it was the weekend. I pulled up and two ppl were already leaving the store with their donut boxes so I knew the place would be popular. The donut man was very nice and he even put extra donut holes in my boxes for free. I was craving donuts and I couldn't help myself so I got a dozen and a half lol. The place had plenty of donuts so they were not going to run out. You can see the quality of the donuts through the glass, whereas compared to spudnuts when I got there I could tell spudnuts was not as good quality. Well now I know where my go to place for donuts is and it's just down the street. Best of all the donuts taste really good too, I think the best ones so far are the glazed and jelly filled donuts. Also the donut man gives you some extra donut holes for free! I will be back soon",2021-09-12 21:42:33

Until recently they started to put baby bunnies in this big plastic container so everyone and their mother can touch and pick up the rabbits with no supervision at all. I am a rabbit owner and I know exactly how rabbits should be treated and handled. 

I went to talk to an employee about my concern about the rabbits being exposed like that. However, her response was neither reassuring or factual. She said rabbits should be exposed so they become more social. This can be true to an extent. However, I don't see any rabbit or even a human wanting to be picked up, touched, screamed at, etc while they're trying to rest.

We ordered food by pointing at the menu because the waitress couldn't hear us. My biggest issue, however, came with how relaxed they were about the mask mandate. The band got off stage with the tip bucket and went to each table unmasked. The band walked around a few other times during breaks to go to take a break without mask. Our waitress walked to our table and lowered her mask once arriving. Also, customers were free to walk around the place maskless.

KLpm1RqdBHkjQx_JlyWZvw,3,"Surprisingly, there aren't that many Americanized Chinese restaurants in the CBD/French Quarter. As good as Cajun/Creole food may be, one just has the need to fill their belly with some greasy Chinese stuff every once in a while.

That being said, this spot hits the spot. The place is huge - probably to accommodate drunk tourists at night - and they're usually pretty busy, and the staff was pretty friendly as well.

For the price tag, the portions are pretty sizable. Even their lunch specials have more than average portion. Another thing I like about this joint is that you have the option to get the shrimp fried rice for your lunch menu - which I've never seen.

As for the important stuff - the taste, they're pretty average. Their general tso's chicken, of which I ordered it extra spicy, wasn't spicy at all, but it was on par with mediocre Chinese restaurants across the country. 

The thing I shocked me about this place is the inconsistency from their menu description from the website. When you look at the menu from Grubhub, the plain fried rice is described as, ""Prepared steamed white rice with soy sauce, eggs, peas, carrots and green onions."" Look at the picture of the plain fried rice I'd received - what a joke. There was not a whiff of the eggs, peas, carrots or green onions. They really need to work on the menu. Not only that, it tasted just like white rice mixed with soy sauce, and it tasted ridiculously bad. Their pork fried rice, on the other had, was pretty good. Mild, and lots of pork pieces.

Also, their baby corn that was in my bean curd went bad - it tasted awful.

All in all, I would go there again, as long as I stick to the stuff that I know already, like general tso's chicken.",2019-03-14 02:16:02

Only hours before closing, we had to scramble to get letters from our banks to allow electronic payment to be made. 

Wen a complaint call about the botching of the paperwork by one of their employees was made, the owner/principal kept repeating that it was ""our policy"" despite the fact that it was not included in their detailed instructions on how to complete the paperwork.

rzFuz9Fh-Nmf_rmO4U2KQA,1,"I happily ordered a $135 hoagie tray in person on Friday and paid for it in advance in person in CASH so I could run in on Sunday and pick it up 
I had my grandson and little nephews coming to a pumpkin decorating party at 1pm at my house 

This day was a literal nightmare.I don't have enough words to describe what went on in their shop today. When I got in to pick up my tray I was told by the manager I didn't pay for it .  I gave his the "" future order"" rcpt that was given to me and he said that doesn't prove I paid for anything. I don't have another $135 laying around. I went through my step-by-step with him so that he would understand that I had paid for it. He didn't budge. HE EVEN SAID HE REMEMBERED ME COMING IN AND SAID HE WAS SURE I DIDNT PAY.  Horror set it. The party was starting at 1 o'clock. I stopped by to pick up my order at 10:30.  An hour and a half later I begged and pleaded and tried to make sense but f it . The self proclaimed manager would make no iContact with me , told me he was going to put me out of the store if I continued. and claimed he was on the phone with the owner (while he giggled and smiled ) during his 30 minute call. I think he felt if he ignored me I would go away.  Customers came in and out and couldn't understand why I was there crying. I live nearby I've been a customer  on and off for 12 years.  
My son-in-law offered to pay AGAIN but I said I would not pay twice OVER MY DEAD BODY and this was unfair. It was a freaking tray of hoagies. COMMIN SENSE - Why would I stand there for an hour and a half  crying over a tray of hoagies if I was trying to steal it. Once the owner arrived I was told that was impossible IMPOSSIBLE , IMPOSSIBLE that I had paid for it. Also he said ""I heard you yelling while I was on the phone (so what?) He said That they don't take payments before pick up. That their cash register wouldn't even open on a preorder(?) (it opened fine when they took my money on Friday) 
I explained that I did not know what went on on their side of the counter but on my side for a fact I paid in cash. They were more than rude.  They were  belittling with lots of eye rolling , smirks, giggles, accusations , I was told Again and again and again that I was wrong. That I had not paid and I was not getting my hoagie tray.  I'm in disbelief. 
Honestly, I do not look or act like a thief. If I was a thief Why would I stand there in public and cry and insist and plead for an last hour and a half.  Can't they check the register recpts? What the hell. 

Finally at almost 1pm the owner reviews the video from friday !!! He was so rude and so sure of himself Had to REVIEW THE STORE VIDEO... are you kidding me ?? He called me in the back quickly and told me that he had proof that I did not pay. But for some reason he had stopped the video 5 seconds too early...( what the heck ) I asked him to continue the video for another 10 seconds and there it was, me paying in cash for my platter. The cashier putting my money in the register .  The self proclaimed manager seemed disappointed..as I came out ....( He was smiling when I went back to the owners excitement that he had proof)
Seemed upset that I was correct.  let me remind you this was a hoagie tray it's what they sell day and night.  what did they plan to do with my hoagies if they ran me out of the shop????  Ruined my day. My night and left a huge imprint on me. Wasted my time- I felt like I aged 10 years.  I have NEVER EVER HAD THE INSINUATION THAT I WAS A CROOK BESTOWED ON ME   and I'm a 63 year old nice decent lady. Even after that it was like pulling teeth to get someone to help me get the tray to my car. The manager wouldn't touch it. All I can say is that I am still crying on the inside that they put me through this.  They were mad and weirdly mad.   

This has so UNSETTLED ME.. feels like I had a crazy bad dream. Two hours in their shop and they WOULDNT EVEN admit that it was possible possible they made a mistake .  They was no waivering that it was even remotely possible that I paid and they made a
Mistake.   No chance. Zero zip nada 
I AM SO MAD AT WHAT THEY PUT ME THRU JUST TO PROVE THEY WERE RIGHT when they weren't.  I had to ASK , yes ASK for an apology.  Not even a discount on my order for a 2 hour ordeal.  No one wanted to apologize.
Not good or  honorable people.  I HOPE IT WAS WORTH THEIR TIME.  They forever lost my business and 15 of my local friends and relatives but that's nothing compared to how I feel about this. .  
I'm still shaking .  I have a question.... If I was unable to prove that I paid .. what were they planning to do with the hoagies throw them away.? They need to learn a lesson here. Respect your customers have sympathy and consideration
If this from my hoagie shop at that point I would have just given the trade to the lady .. out of pity. I mean they were obscene",2021-10-17 23:52:49

HBoYn6TUFcx9vciA3odJ9g,1,"I wanted a replacement for our aging van, searched online a very long time.  Found one myself, contacted the dealership, and paid the 250,00 transfer fee.  I had to call them to see if it had gotten there and received no follow up call to let me know it had gotten there, which got my attention.
--The vehicle was in good shape, and looked good and mileage was accurate, road tested good,  although i noticed the rear tires had a noticeable saw tooth pattern on the outside edges, and during the paperwork stage i brought up to the sales man the problem and asked to have them replaced with a matching set just on the rear and rotate to the front.  The sales man said he would create a service ticket for it to go in for repairs. I asked for them to furnish roof rack crossover bars, a second key fob, and an owners manual. Funny thing is, the KIA Dealership is within spitting distance, right next door.  they valued my trade at 500.00, which was meticulously maintained albeit 12 years old and valued at trade 1000.00 minimum. I also asked to refund the transfer fee since I committed to buying the van.  Here is how the purchase went:
--I could not use my van as trade and get money off for the sales tax, which hurt.  I ended up selling it myself 4 months later for 1750.00. 
--They said they would not furnish new tires, that they passed their rigorous inspection standards on the initial checkout, which i picked out on the lot (to be fair, i am an ex mechanic.)
--They would not refund the transfer fee.
--They would not get us a new fob, again the KIA dealer was next door and they had a week to do it.
--They would not get the roof crossover bars, a 350.00 expense, again available next door.
--They said to go on the website for a paper version for the owner's manual on Helminc.com, not avail.  on KIA's website.  They state that they will reimburse you if you have to buy it.
--Long story short, I bought the manual, showed them the shipping receipt and credit card charges since KIA would not give me the receipt in the package or when i called them (KIA) showed the Lady at the counter at CARMAX my proof of purchase, said she could not get me a 25.00 refund since it was not actually a receipt. I gave up after that. This was the final punch in the stomach/ fart in the face I got from them.

- Grocery Outlet is next door
- Pool looked clean and everyone socially distanced around the pool

- Tv worked

- This place is supposed to be covid clean, but considering the parking lot was full outside... I doubt that rooms are being left empty for more than 12 hours before the next guest comes in.
- Hair on the floor in the bathroom
- Dirty tiled floor in general... I would being sandals to walk around this hotel room

You can catch some beautiful views of the Benjamin Franklin bridge and some Philly skyscrapers. The inside is pretty well maintained, the lawn could use some geese poo cleaning, but with the lawn chairs available it was less noticeable after sunset!  

They have all kinds of fast food and drinks available, but be prepared to pay $$$$  . Beers start from 13 bucks but you get a $5 shots after that. So also be prepared to see a lot of drunk people lol.. 
the fries there were pretty good! The bathrooms are functioning and neat. Not too long lines which was great! 

The only sad/mad experience was that they make you park at least 4 blocks away and that also cost 30$ . Then when I parked and got to the entrance they said I can't carry my bag, the bag only had a picnic blanket. So had to go all the way back to put the bag in the car and walk back again.

I waited over a hour for service! I understand there may be a wait time, but if it is going to be a while COMMUNICATE that to your client! With all of the stylist being busy, they decided to have the cleanup lady cut the sew-in out of my hair! Upon undoing my own braids I removed chucks of hair that looked like my own.. After waiting almost 2 hours I decided to leave.. I did my own relaxer that day, which I usually always do.. Since my hair had been bone straight and I don't usually investigate the back of my head.. I didn't notice until about 3 months down the line how much hair the cleanup lady had cut out of my head!!!!!! Now sitting here months after with one side of the back of my head being totally uneven, i'm on the verge of just shaving the back off! -_- In the end I'm just glad I left before they tried putting the relaxer in my head without combing it first. One of the stylist said my hair was too thick and they would have to put the relaxer on before untangling it. Which is another reason I left. I'm no stylist but I know a relaxer should NOT be done without untangling it first!!! They would have had to cut most of my hair off if I didn't have enough sense and actually let them do it!

b9YePlTse26I3ZJxoH9GLQ,1,"Power Home Remodeling's approach is entirely too high-pressure and sexist. First, a representative came to the door and asked if there was a time they could come by and do an estimate. I was very busy, but said the following week would work. The rep insisted that the appointment needed to be same day as there were already people in the neighborhood. 

Then, I was put on the phone with a dispatcher to ""send someone out"", indicating people were actually not in the area at all.  

That raised some red flags for me. Then, both the female rep and the male dispatcher were insistent that my husband be there for the measurement of the windows. That told me that perhaps the measurement appointment was not going to be just measurement. (Something later confirmed when I looked at the BBB reviews of the company. ""Window measurement"" somehow turns into a multi-hour sales call, it seems.)  And that the company was too stuck in the 1950s to realize that 1.) Some women are completely able to handle appointments, 2.) Some women make the financial decisions for the household, and 3.) Some women are homeowners without husbands.",2021-06-18 17:02:37

The crowning glory however is the outdoor patio and televisions. This is a great place to watch a sporting event or movie. They have the biggest outdoor screen I have seen short of a drive-in theater! Just make sure you go once it is dark. Bathrooms are clean as well as the bar. There is also pool on the outdoor patio.

There is a toll to take the bridge and they do have fishing exits to go to the old bridge location that is now a fishing pier.  The bridge itself is also beautiful and just one of those landmarks of TB.  They haven't upgraded these toll booths like the other highways around whereby you don't have to slow when passing through....possibly they'll plan on upgrading but be expected to slow down when going through the toll booths -- which does cause traffic to build up at times.

My family really enjoyed the nature trail that leads to the overlook. Once you make it to the top you can see Apollo Beach and Tampa's Skyline in the distance. On a cold day I totally suggest you bring a heavy jacket, walking shoes and maybe even gloves. 

I am so happy this place exist, they provide a great deal of information on manatees. These animals are so beautiful yet many of them get injured by irresponsible boaters.

On another note... 
We are little curious about the cleanliness of the water. The viewing center is located on the power plant. I understand that the manatees are seeking warmer waters in the winter... but is the water free of toxic waste?",2018-01-06 07:10:34

I don't eat eggs, but I do eat steak. To me, fruit or home fries seems a reasonable substitution for the 3 eggs that come with the order, but they treat the meal as though it came pre-packaged and nothing can be done to get you what you want. You can leave the eggs off entirely, but it will cost you the same. Lastly, medium rare came still mooing.

VsWNYa6IdLv4X9sWUHOPgA,1,"This place has a great location, a great building, good beer, and pretty decent food, but there's no reason that anyone should subject themselves to the treatment that the owner, management and a portion of the staff here give customers.  I don't know if it's still going on, but a couple of the employees at the Brewpub used to pull a scam to steal from customers.  About a year and a half ago, realizing that they had done this to my table on my way out the door, I tried to turn around to talk to a manager.  The person at the door insisted that I couldn't turn around without (re)paying their $10 cover charge.  I explained that I just wanted to go back in to clear up a bill issue with the manager, and they still refused to let me in.  I offered that, if they preferred, they could ask the manager to come to the door, at which point their security guard began to threaten me.  At that point, I figured that the small amount that they'd stolen wasn't worth the trouble of dealing with them.

The next day, I called to tell a manager about what had happened.  I would have thought that he'd be glad that someone told him, instead of just steering people away from the place silently.  When I finished the story, the manager asked ""Why the **** are you telling me?""  So, I asked to speak to the owner.  The owner was audibly drunk and yelled ""You people all just want something for nothing!!! [A bunch of expletive laden nonsense.]"" (Mind you, I wasn't asking for anything.)

After that, I, obviously, was reluctant to go back.  Some friends cajoled me into it a couple of weeks ago, though, and the experience was again poor.  My food came out cold.  I asked if they could reheat it but the waiter seemed unable to handle that on his own.  The manager came over and told me that he knew I just wanted my meal for free and that he wasn't going to do it.  In the end, my food was never reheated.

The owner of the Brewpub and some of his managers are truly abusive people.  You're online, so you can find plenty of more egregious stories of their misconduct for yourself.  As much as this place has going for it, do not risk going here.  Hopefully, after alienating enough people, they will go out of business and someone capable of treating others with basic dignity will take over that location.",2013-10-06 02:30:18

The next day the leg was twice the size it was the day before. I called and asked if I should follow up there or at my regular physician and was advised that I could definitely follow up there.

The guys who work at this location were literally an answer to my prayers--a total Godsend!!  I am so grateful for these guys.  Thank you, thank you, thank you so much!!!

They say that an honest mechanic is worth his weight in gold. I've got to tell you, these guys are totally platinum! They were incredibly honest and wonderfully skillful and they fixed the problem, also checking all of my fluids in addition  to everything else to make sure that I could get back home to Tempe safely in my car! 

The best part about it is this: the entire bill, even with as much time as they took making sure my car would run OK and as much they did to repair it, was only $18!!!

I was amazed!

The thing is that I didn't know what I was going to do when my car started breaking down.  We had checked out of our hotel and had nowhere to stay that night and knew no one in Tucson.  I didn't have a lot of money for costly repairs and didn't know what I was going to do.  I was really stuck and really at the mercy of whatever the mechanic would say.

It is a real testament to the character of the people who work at this location that they were so honest and so honorable.  I can't tell you how much it meant to me. I am so grateful to God for answering my prayers, and so grateful to these guys for being that answer and being there when I really needed them.

It took 20 minutes to get water. The couple who came in 10 minutes after us had already gotten water and put their order in before we even got water. By that point, we knew what we wanted to order so as soon as we got our water we wanted to put in the order ASAP because we were starving. I ordered the stuffed french toast and my husband orders the biscuits & Gravy. Nothing came with a side of eggs and bacon or anything like that. Most places offer sides with your entree. You had to pay extra so we ordered the extra sides because we were hungry. The french toast was just two pieces of bread with a slab of cream cheese in the middle with a raspberry sauce. Not worth $10 by any means. Maybe if it was more than two pieces of bread and it included the sides it would have been worth $10. The sausage and eggs I got on the side tasted like they were frozen and thrown in a microwave. My husband got the biscuits and gravy and the plate was tiny and the biscuits were just small.

First time hiring a moving company and to say I'm less than impressed would be an understatement. Hiring the movers was painless, on and off the phone in 10 minutes, fine. 

Movers were scheduled for Saturday arriving between 9 and 10 am. Hourly rate is $150/hr for 2 movers at 3 hours minimum, first time mover so I didn't question it. 

10:15am of move day comes around and other than a confirmation email 4 days prior, nothing. No call confirming them being on the way, so I decided to call-8 times-- to see what was causing the delay. No answer, okay, weird. Their location is 5 minutes from my house, so I drive there to speak to someone in person. 1431 Ivy Hill Rd location listed in Google and THEIR WEBSITE isn't even Sunshine Movers!! The business there is Public Storage, when I walked inside they had no idea who Sunshine Movers were. 

I nearly broke my thumbs calling my bank to reverse my deposit with them, no issues on their end. 

2.5 hours later after the maximum arrival time I get a text from Jay from Sunshine, which I did not consent to being contacted via text and after the text I called back and after a less than satisfactory apology he tried to proceed with the moving services.

My friend's boyfriend had the steak medallions and had great things to say.  (He would usually cooks these amazing meals for us on Sunday nights at his home so his thumbs up meant a lot - thanks Jeff : )  I guess they have a new chef who used to be a high end restaurant in Chesterfield.  

Servers were attentive and friendly.  Great music on the patio.  Great Food.

5 stars and will be going back!",2014-08-17 16:46:22

The meat was very flavorful and you really didn't need to add any hot sauce or salsa verde. I ordered a carnitas sope and the menudo (extra limes).

First off, the manager, John, is sincerely the nicest guy I have ever met in my life.  He's everything you could want in a GM.  

The staff was totally attentive with zero pretensions.  Rare for Fishtown anymore.  The build out is awesome, it's unlike any bar around.

can't speak for the food because I packed it to go to finish it at home in peace and quiet. And then lost my appetite all together... awful experience. No apology from the server. 


I have ""Duchess"" status at this particular location so I've been here MANY times and for the most part the food is excellent.

Yes, we were seated by the mall doors. To say this was insulting does not even begin to describe it.

I found the chair I wanted priced at $4000 on sale for $2299. I was lead to another chair by the sales associate talking about how great this chair was and that she had sold hundreds of these and never had any complaint. It did feel comfortable but seemed the foam in the cushions back and head were too soft and might be subject to detoriating quickly. The associate said I could just take it to an upholstery shop and have extra foam added.... Strange answer for this high end $3300 chair. I ended up placing an order after more discussion of how perfect and never one complaint after a few hundred sales on this item. I came home and started researching the chair and found many horrible reviews. I was astonished! I texted the sales associate that I wanted to cancel the order. I received the same sales pitch, finally agreed to change over to the first chair I liked but I said no, I want the order cancelled. I called my credit card company and they said we will do a 3 way call on Monday and insure this is credited back. My credit card was charged before I could drive home. It was credited back and I researched the so called $4000.00 chair they had on sale for $2299. Shocked again!

Decided to make a reservation online today through their website which they direct you to when you call in and the website takes you to Open-table. Open-table stated ""sorry this restaurant isn't available to reserve on open table""(see attached pic) I then decided to give the location a call at 3pm and I spoke with Jamie Smith. I informed her that I was trying to make a reservation and the site wasn't working so I'm calling in. She right away stated that ""well we have blocked off reservation after 5pm"" in such a nasty attitude. I stated that the site didn't give you the option to choose a time it just stated that the location wasn't taking reservations. She repeated to me that she was trying it on her tablet and that it was working on Yelp. I stated that your site directs you to Open-table so I'm not sure why I would be on Yelp doing this. She then said ""well ma'am I have to go"" in a very rude manner as she misgendered me without even stating an apology. I am a military Sergant and never have I ever in my 10 years been told over the phone or in person that I sound like a female. I then asked to speak to a manger which she stated in fact she was the manger. I don't understand how calling in to make a reservation turned out so rudely from someone that's supposed to be a ""Manager"" and then she proceeded to dismiss me after misgendering me instead of simply apologizing and seeing what she could do to making my reservation. I have been to multiple drunken fish locations and never have I ever experienced service like this.

The staff were all very nice.  Not too formal and very attentive.  Our waiter was extremely attentive and made sure no drinks went empty throughout the entire dinner. As others have mentioned, there is not a menu.  The waiter recites it, and it's pretty simple.  There is only one app, the onion rings.  Of course get them.  Onion rings were pretty tasty.  Huge pile and easy to munch on.  Seasoned well.  They were a shoe-string type which I enjoy compared to the thickies. These onion rings are pretty darn good.  4/5.  In the end, they are just onion rings.  

I got a wedge salad with homemade blue cheese dressing.  Not great.  I usually enjoy a good wedge, but I was underwhelmed.  Lettuce was chilled and served with a fat tomato.  My thought was, ""meh.""  I ate about half.  2/5.

I had the ribeye medium rare, and it came out sizzling.  Charlie's definitely serves the sizzle with the steak. These steaks are more buttery than salty.  Unfortunately, I belong to the salty camp when it comes to beef.  Another issue was the marbling, little too much for a ribeye.  Meat was on the tough side, which translates into a chewy wad with ribeyes.  I continually salted my steak, but that's just me.  

Overall, I will not repeat Charlie's.  There just isn't enough charm for the level of steaks they're serving.",2017-03-31 02:24:00

We went with the chefs menu and we chose the 10 day smoked ribs. The first dish that came out was an assortment of spreads that went along with some crisps and bread. Super delicious. My favorite was the duck blood spread! I love how they gave us a sneak peak of the ribs before the cut it and served it to us. The anticipation of waiting really made the rib worth it! It was so good that I forgot to get a picture of it. 

The dessert was also one of my favorite. From the chefs menu, they came out with a bacon and cream dessert. Looks nothing special from the presentation of the dessert but once you eat it, you will want more. Settle crunches of bits of bacon and super nice a creamy. They also gave a complimentary cake for my boyfriends birthday. I forgot what kind of cake it was because I mostly ate the bacon and cream dessert.

I also purchased a Westfield product, From Costco, the zero gravity lounge chair and I have never had a better and more comfortable chair ever in my 60 plus years here on Earth (I'm not from Earth by the way, just here on vacation). Everyone that comes to the house and tries the lounge immediately wants to get one for themselves (I have arranged for shipment to the four corners of our Galactic possessions) . I had a minor problem with the bungee cords fraying and snapped that hold the chair together. I waited for a few days before calling them to check on the price of a new cord. I really did not expect them to have replacements as some of the cheaper imitations do not (my bad for trying to be cheapo). Well, after sending TONYA (a very nice earthling) an email, I was very pleasantly surprised to find out that they have the cords, AND I was going to receive one free of charge and not have to pay shipping. Thank You TONYA and THANK YOU WESTFIELD for having such great Customer service, and a great Zero Gravity chair (it is a lot like my flight cockpit chair when I turn off the artificial gravity and coast to the nearest Refueling station).

Kho08pWNfeGnRbZTnMKy3w,4,"When I moved to Nashville the thing that I thought I'd miss the most is having an abundance of fresh seafood. However, it seems that every other new place that opens in Nashville is seafood! Lucky me! 

We came here on a weekday afternoon for lunch lured by the idea of a sushi burrito which combines two of my favorite foods. The concept of Zushipoke involves customization for your bowl or sushi burrito. There is a counter where you can create your own or choose a specialty item and still add or change it to your liking. Both myself and my boyfriend got the monster sushi burrito. This comes with three proteins: krab (imitation crab), tuna and shrimp. It has cucumber, avocado, tempura pieces all mixed in a sauce before rolled up in rice and soy paper. I substituted the shrimp out for salmon and my boyfriend left out the avocado (something I would never do!) but asked for a tortilla instead of the soy paper wrapper. I assumed that by leaving the soy paper wrapper I'd be cutting the carbs but there was so much rice in mine since that had to adhere to the soy paper. The result was that my boyfriend's sushi burrito had more  protein and less rice so I wish I had done this substitution as well! The taste was great and it was served with a side of some sort of creamy mayo, wasabi and ginger. 

We both enjoyed the food and the atmosphere was casual and clean. However, the workers were a bit slow and kept asking me to repeat my order. It is definitely on the pricey side too since it was $32 for two sushi burritos and 1 drink. Despite these couple of nit picky things it was overall a good experience.",2018-09-22 01:08:57

After many visits, I'm always surprised at how full and healthy she manages my brows while having the expertise to know exactly what hairs to remove that would create the most complementary shape.  I've always had one of the two compromised when asking for full and arched looks that left me with thinner brows with super unnatural arched shapes and until I had a consultation with Shelby, I just accepted that reality. After multiple visits I realized she really worked hard to find a sweet spot for my eyebrows, and what seems like a small service created such remarkable results for my confidence. I feel my eyebrows have reached a new prime in Shelby's hands and I return to the Spa for Shelby's technical work, honesty, unmatched hospitality.",2022-01-07 18:02:11

pLE9PzQ-3BNFbGjrMSxo2Q,2,"I used to consistently go to Datz. I remember years ago when Datz specialized in sandwiches and they were delicious. Prior to today's brunch I tried Datz for dinner and due to the average food and poor service I did not return for over a year.

However, today my mother in law and wife wanted brunch. So I decided to give datz one more try. I wish I hadn't. For three reasons:

1.The wait- Yes it's a Sunday and brunch is crowded, but we called in at 11.15 am and were assured that the wait would be an hour. We were seated 1 hour and 20 minutes later. We waited another 10 minutes for our waiter to come by. Finally we ordered food and waited close to an hour for the food to arrive. 
2. Excuses - The waiter did not attempt to make things right. Instead he attributed the wait to an unexpected party of 25 people. He took zero initiative and did not offer anything complementary or any discount on the bill. Maybe that's the norm for Datz.
3. The food - Everyone in my party was too hungry to send the food back. However, the corned beef hash was oily and undercooked and the pastrami benedict was room temperature and way too salty.

The prices for the cocktails, beer, wine are fantastic! The food selection for the happy hour is absolutely amazing! It's a great price and you can have a full dinner on the happy hour menu without breaking the bank. 

I told the bartenders today that I could come and order 20 orders of the whipped ricotta, it is just that good. The negronis are my favorite drink on HH and are so freshly made with perfect ratio of ingredients. All of the other seasonal cocktails and small bites are great, as well. 

Above anything else, the staff there are so nice, hospitable, and accommodating. I have been there a few times and chatted with John and have even started asking for him by name, as he is so sweet! I met Andrew today and he was so welcoming and cheerful. It's so great to meet great bartenders in a center city area that remember regulars, since it is such a busy area!

My wife started with a Caesar salad that wasn't the best but good. She loves the bruschetta that she makes a meal out of. They are located on the top of the menu and can be ordered by the piece.
I had Chicken parmigiana with a side spaghetti. It really was just ok. The spaghetti was a bit over cooked. The chicken was cooked well but needed a bit more parmigiana. We were there a few weeks ago and I had Braised Beef Contadina. The portion was huge and it was delicious. 
We had cappuccino and creme brûlée- both excellent. 
The place is quite busy so I suggest a reservation. There hostess was very pleasant as well as the server. We didn't have to look for him. It's a bit noisy and hectic but a good family place.

We drove up to order and my husband placed his burger order, the lady quickly said our total and was ready to be done. We told her we had a few more orders and she tried to rush through and seemed annoyed we had more. She cc'd was rushing us so much I asked my husband to have her repeat the order, which she got wrong so we corrected her. We went back & fourth a few times and Findlay got so frustrated that she wasn't listening that we just said fine. Our order was still wrong and we had to wait around back for her to correct it. 

The gems were cold and stale, the chicken strips were cut in tiny pieces- very weird. The finger steaks were fine, not amazing though.

My whole thing is consistency and quality and on those two things alone, Blue Oak has NEVER disappointed. Not to mention you get a little lagniappe- creativity, flavor profiles you haven't explored before, exemplary customer service, and amazing vibes! (NTM their Monday and Friday mood posts ) 
What more can I say ? I mean everyone has to be #BlessedbyBlueOak at least once. 

Last, but not least Blue Oak really took to our hearts with how they stepped up for the community and the city during the pandemic last year, providing free, superior quality food to those in need. I mean, overwhelming isn't a strong enough emotion.

Being from Denver, CO this was my first gater sausage and it was divine! Spicy like andouille but the texture is a bit more crisp than pork. It was the perfect complement to a plate of rosemary grits, eggs and the best homemade biscuit this side of the Mississippi! They also offer a solid selection of morning cocktails.

The thing about this place that is special is... Well, ya know the whole eat local movement? This place perfectly showcases what is special about south la food. Yes no is delicious and yes we plan dinner for tomorrow before we finish breakfast today- but this right here...

The good: the specials! I've yet to eat off the menu because the daily specials are really special. Today I had the heirloom salad w pickled okra, crouton made from corn bread and lump crab. Look at that crab. Look at it!!!!

Less good: I'm sorry I ate by myself bc I totally wanted the super special lamb pro boy that was not on menu or board- am I could have tricked- ahem- encouraged someone else to get it so I could try.

For dessert I opted for chocolate chess pie over the grilled donut- cuz they have one- but I couldn't justify it w just me. But the chess pie was super special also. Warm with a crunch and crumbly crust.

Last- got a cantaloupe soda- not too sweet. Very nice.

I guess one says that the people running it are obviously business geniuses because the restaurant stays pretty full and the food is really not a very good deal relative to the price. No, the food is not bad but the food is very uninspired and mundane and as I've said not terribly cheap. I suspect the real formula here is they have an immense menu on which you can get just about anything so it's great if you're entertaining a group who can't agree on what they want and who have low standards in terms of their culinary tastes.

Village Inn used to be a great place to occasionally grab breakfast. 
First, the worst table in the house is the table closest to the restrooms. (Somehow they tried to seat us there today-yuk), I spoke up and got a much better table. 
Our server was nice, but she didn't greet us for over 5 minutes and then had to wait another few minutes to order and we were hungry and ready to put our entire order in.
The kids meals are 3.99, but only one piece of bread for the French toast meal. What? My child was still hungry after her ""breakfast"" It used to be 2 pieces of French toast cut up into 8 pieces.
I had the garden skillet which was great, but again the portion size has shrunk big time and prices went up. Doesn't make sense. 
We won't be back. We will be supporting The Metro Diner instead.

EA-bfqoCUGzvaHUQ35pbMg,1,"It has now been a week since my horrific experience and I am still bothered by it. I have struggled with whether or not I would speak publicly about what I experienced and have come to the conclusion that I would share my experience in hopes that no one else would be subjected to such treatment. Saks Fifth Avenue has left me disgusted at the behavior that was displayed by employees who were specifically hand picked by management and chosen to represent their brand!  Not only will I NEVER return, I will tell everyone that I know how this particular store treats their customers. On Saturday, April 6th at approximately 5:00 p.m. I was made to feel less than human as my race undermined my credibility in this high end retail store.  While I was not wholly denied access, I was treated differently. In many ways, this a microcosm of racial exclusions embedded in American society.  I am saddened and repulsed by the gross display of disrespect, disregard and overall rudeness that I endured at the hands of their employees. 

I will be graduating from a local university next month. I have worked hard and am proud of my accomplishments. As a reward, I decided to treat myself to a pair of high end shoes. Obviously, the first place that I thought of was Saks. My friend and I took the 20 minute drive to Frontenac to make the purchase. As soon as we entered the store (which was practically empty), the alarm activated. Being that we'd just walked in we both looked at each other with confusion and proceeded to walk to the shoe department. By now we notice two store clerks motioning to one another. While we were fully aware of their actions, knowing that we hadn't done anything wrong we continued to make our way to women's shoes.  

The female employee in the shoe department did not greet us. Meanwhile, I calmly and politely asked her if she could direct me to a particular brand of shoes. She then proceeded to ask me if I knew what size I needed. I explained to her that since the shoes are not American made, the size may be different. At no point did she direct us to an area with this particular brand. The saleswoman and I stood awkwardly face to face and in silence as she looked me up and down with pure disgust. While I was taken aback by her boldness, I chuckled slightly in disbelief. Did I smell? Was I not pleasant? Why was she interested in my appearance and not directing me to what I asked for?  She finally responds with a snide grin and says, ""Let me see what we have in the back!"" Now I'm really confused. You're checking to see what's in the back?  Other than me stating the brand of shoe that I was interested in, I stood patiently waiting to be directed to a display of shoes where I could choose what I wanted. What exactly was she checking for in the back? I didn't know exactly what I wanted, how could she? Maybe I was not privy to her physic abilities. That's it!  She was able to read my mind! The salesperson returns literally within two minutes and says to us, ""We don't have what you're looking for!"" Oh! Now we get it! No need to say more! As we walked out of the store we see the other two clerks motioning to one another again.  Extremely offended, my friend and I left the store shaking our heads in disbelief at what had just transpired. In closing, while I can't seem to forget the phrase, ""We don't have what you're looking for!"" out of my head, I still have faith in humanity. No one should ever have to feel belittled or less than because of the color of their skin. I suppose the folks at Saks didn't get the memo. Get on board people! This is 2019!",2019-04-13 20:44:53

The biscuits themselves are so soft and delicious! You can get the east nasty with spicy chicken as well and it's called the nasty princess! haha The bonuts were alright - not a huge fan of them, not as sweet as I would've hoped they would've been but I guess that's where the biscuit flavor comes in. Side note - their chai latte was great! They have their own mix so it isn't your standard tazo chai taste you get almost everywhere else which I appreciated it!

hzEHbzC49hFmFIZxMY47JQ,5,"Love Shack, Baby love shack....

Shake shack has been one of my favorite burgers for a long time. Now, I haven't had In and Out as yet. But put most burgers, gourmet too, the Shackburger is burger love for me. 

So I only waited for the crowd's hustle and bustle to die down to have it after 2 years! And it did not disappoint. 

I love the OG - single patty shack burger. I get it with everything minus the bacon and onions. The patty is so succulent and flavorful. The cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato and the soft buttery bun balance the portion of the patty so well. I was hungry and I did order the double cheeseburger. The flavor, heartiness, and the feeling of satisfaction is like dopamine. It was very meaty. So in retrospect, I would get two single shackburgers because the flavors are just perfectly well-balanced. 

Also, I did add peppers and it adds a sweet kick to the burger. Makes it a tad spicy and savory. 

For me Shack Shack makes the best basic fries for the price point. It's crispy, thick and just rightly salted. And, then there is the shake. Now, I agree that for the price, the shake could be bigger. And there is a 50c charge for malt too, which I highly recommend as it elevates the milkshake flavor. We ordered the black and white and, it made it richer and creamier. I did wish the quantity was more. 

So we ordered through the app, which Shack Shack recommends too. So the pick up is a separate counter and it was pretty quick and smooth. However, the caveat is the concretes were not available to order through the app and the shake flavors were limited. So we will have to revisit (gladly!) to try that.

Given that you can order through an app, they are open till 11 pm, there is plenty of seating in and out, all I am going to say is there is new kid on the block in the burger neighborhood.",2018-09-03 20:27:39

The Princess entree is so good that I went back twice to have it before I left home. The dish comes with 1 biscuit, hot chicken, honey, mustard, and pickles. This is one of the best meals I've had in my life easily. There is so much flavor and the biscuit is so flaky and rich. I am usually not a fan of biscuits, but this place changed my mind. 

The fruit tea is also amazing. When you buy a cup, you get free refills. The fruit tea is southern sweet tea with a mix of fruits. It is refreshing and delicious for those hot Nashville days. The desserts are also so delicious! The Bonuts are rich and full of flavor and the b roll is amazingly indulgent.

Due to current events, they did not have the toppings for the two pizzas I wanted to try. The service was fair. They were kind but seemed like they didn't care/ didn't want to be there. However, their crust is divine -- so light yet full. I love how crisp the bottom of the crust is. No soggy bottoms on these pies! Looking forward to trying other styles in the future.",2020-04-21 22:35:42

Nhy14qa7PBF4qksvsXEHDw,4,"I've now been about four or five times and have had great food and drink experiences each time.  Once I was being difficult and asked for a virgin ""whatever"" (I wasn't able to have alcohol on that visit) and the adorable bartender made me a custom, delish, bubbly cucumber drinky thing that made me not so cranky.  I would say that the food is NOLA pub-grub style and I love it.  I wouldn't go there for a dinner but I would absolutely go there for shareable snacks.  

I have had great experiences sitting at the bar.  I did have some issues with a waitress during my last visit.  Everything my party requested was met with irritation.  A glass of ice for our whiskey, for example.  I didn't think we were very needy or asked for unusual or ridiculous things.   Her attitude did concern me because everyone there has always been extremely friendly and helpful.  I will go back but will avoid her tables.",2019-09-19 19:09:34
fpiirm8MU_hSJBjHpbtIUA,3,"Tried this place for the first time last night.  A little on the pricey side, but I liked the experienced.

We sat outside on the deck at one of the aluminum picnic tables (there were a few non-picnic tables as well).  Service was prompt, bringing out chips and salsa and water with the menus.  I really liked the chips and salsa - the salsa has a nice kick to it, as well as being quite flavorful.

I ordered the birria, while my friend ordered the burrito.  Like the salsa, the birria was flavorful.  I had a bite of my friends burrito, and it was good as well.  The beans were very tasty, though my guess is that the flavor is mainly from generous use of lard.

I'd go again - nothing amazing, but the food was solid, and being able to sit outside (even if surrounded by a parking lot) is a nice little perk.",2010-07-04 01:17:02
-5bMrFgFsynOjyfT0HjrHg,1,"BIG MISTAKE!! Warning to reconsider taking a motorcycle to this unprofessional shop. I ended up paying Greg's Custom Cycle Works in Clearwater thousands of dollars to supposedly rebuild the top end of the motor to my 2002 Indian Chief.
They kept my motorcycle in and out of the shop for several months but failed at repairs. Parts of it were even damaged while in their possession.
The owner Greg kept dodging my calls and finally months later , has refused to do the right thing and refund any money.
Geico needs to investigate and hopefully remove them from being an official pro repair shop. I now have photos and documentation from a reputable motorcycle mechanic on the East coast to confirm their fraudulent work.

ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw,5,"So my friend and I are standing outside of Capogiro, deciding where we should go to continue our wine buzz from the two bottles we killed at dinner earlier.  Next thing we know, this guy starts chatting us up and invites us to join him and his friend Brian at Apothecary for a drink.  Free drinks at the new place with all the buzz?  Fanfuckintastic!  I love being a girl!  Turns out, ""friend Brian"" is one of the owners and we have an interesting conversation about the lounge as I order my first drink ~ the Sage Wisdom.  The mustached man from Carrie's review was my bartender (she was right--that is one nifty-ass mustache), and he got to work mixing the contents of all kinds of unfamiliar bottles and vials.  Supposedly, the drink is supposed to clarify memory and purify thoughts, but my thoughts were less than pure as I text messaged my boyfriend later in my slightly intoxicated state.  But that is neither here nor there.  The drink was slammin.    

Next drink!  The Dermis Fantasticus tagline is ""achieve the glow,"" which sounded like a good idea to me.  This drink was garnished with a slice of ginger and a sliver of cucumber.  It was interesting, but not as delish as the Sage Wisdom.  Still, glowing skin?  I'll drink to that!

Apothecary is definitely carving itself into a unique niche in the Philly bar scene.  The concept is interesting and fun, and everyone seated at the cozy tables and mingling on the deck outside seemed in no hurry to leave.  I wish Brian and his partners the best, and I'll definitely be back!",2008-06-13 15:03:17
ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw,5,"I can't stop thinking about my dinner at Friday Saturday Sunday earlier this week! Especially dessert. More on that later. 

I'd been to the revamped FSS several times for drinks (I love their bar scene and the bartenders are tops!) but Tuesday night was a first for the dining room. My last dinner there was circa 2008. Back then it was a totally different vibe, different menu, different boyfriend! The new iteration is much brighter and very elegant.   

Our server was excellent (I forget his name - he was so patient and knowledgeable!). He knew the menu inside and out and was able to highlight the gluten-free items for one of my friends. In an effort to keep things light, I went with the asparagus as a starter and the halibut entree. I don't think I've ever ordered a veggie for a starter, aside from the obvious salads, but FSS was a great place to try it! The asparagus was beautifully presented and the broth was bursting with flavor and texture from the black walnut crumble. 

My halibut entree was perfection. I was that girl who didn't offer a bite to my friends because I was hoarding it all to myself. Served with a warm potato salad, the halibut was just wonderful. I enjoyed my meal with glasses of txakoli, which was crisp and effervescent. 

All of us were trying to be reasonably healthy but, when dessert appeared on the house, were weren't turning it away! The panna cotta with blueberries was a hit but the black and tan sundae was right up my alley. I can't believe we (meaning, me) managed to leave a few bites behind. I need that sundae in my life again. Safe to say it won't be long before I'm finding a reason to get back!",2018-09-20 21:14:40

I also order a side of plantains which comes with yummy onions. The tilapia is so soft and juicy and usually I can share this dish with another person plus  one or two side dishes. The fried rice is a little spicy and is lightly crispy. The plantains are sweet and the onions give it a nice kick. The beef patties are really yummy too. The restaurant is small, but once you get seated the food comes out pretty quickly and the servers are super friendly. I also like ordering the ginger juices!",2015-02-13 16:33:57

They said movers would show up between 8am & 10am, by 11am no one had showed up. I called again and they said between 3 & 4pm. 4 pm rolls around no one showed up. Not even a phone call from the company letting me know they werent showing up. They promised they would show up Saturday morning the next day. By 10am no movers Saturday, no phone call. The family that bought our house was scheduled to move in at 3pm that same day. We had to rally the neighbors, rented a 10ft Uhaul, pack only size available and did 5 trips back & forth packing and unpacking. Didnt get everything out until 7pm htat night and had to compensate the family that were scheudled to move in. Complete lack of communication, organization and sympathy from All My Sons.

The pizza is consistently very good. I can't recall the last time we have a bad product. It's one of the few pizzas I can eat the entire slice, including the end crust. The ingredients are always fresh. 

While the product is always good, the service is less consistent. It's usually OK, but sometimes it's way off. Our pick up orders are usually ready in 15 minutes, but of course things vary a lot when they are busy. Today we ordered take out for the first time and it arrived in about 40 minutes. 

Excellent product and value, overall acceptable service. Highly recommend.",2020-12-05 00:45:07
lVW0BD_ZkWVGDVwBurcyWg,3,"I have been here several times and am confident in my 5 star review. Every meal here has been delicious. The waygu beef sliders were my favorite and unfortunately they changed the menu and removed them now. My husband has had the shrimp etouffe several times and always so flavorful and shrimp cooked perfectly. Last night I had the famous black n blue nachos and they were out of this world. The cheese was melted and cooked so well, the chips were crunchy and all the fixings on them were delicious. It's definitely a plate for two as the plate is huge. These are next level nachos. As far as drinks, I've had their strawberry basil balsamic and that's a great drink, my husband has had the oak and smoke and lemon drop which he loved also. This is one of our go to dinner spots in Dunedin. They always have live music when we go so it does get a bit loud but we always sit towards the back. But the front is a lot of fun too! Definitely check out this great Dunedin spot 

UPDATE: The last 2 times I have been here have been tremendous disappointments. Friends and I came for brunch in December and one friend ordered Chicken and waffles and her chicken came out pink and completely undercooked. Luckily she had not bitten into it and had cut into it. They replaced it some other dish that was underwhelming. Last night we went after the Mardi Gras parade. My husbands steak came out burnt around the edges and cold. My nachos that I've always loved so much came out cold and the cheese had hardened, which leaves me to believe that it's not very good cheese they use. Been disappointed the last several visits.",2020-02-24 01:12:38

My husband had a pizza with a cauliflower crust that was surprisingly excellent. I had one of their ""favorites' on the menu that had bbq chicken on it and it was very tasty. My one son actually got the kids mac n' cheese which was really good. I wish I got it! It wasn't Kraft like most places service, it was homemade and wonderful.

The place wasn't cheap, for the 4 of us it was around $60...but that's what you get for this area. Regardless, it was a good experience, friendly service and a clean atmosphere.",2019-01-24 20:54:18
d69F8wnAyCQMWuYQTEFFUw,4,"Bavarian World is a bit dated inside, but that doesn't change the quality of food and pastries that they're making.  My family and I were here after the balloon races a few months back and stopped in for breakfast. The restaurant hadn't been open for too long, but I kind of got the impression that they were having a rough start that day. Our server was the nicest lady. Sadly she was not quick, but she was kind and we could tell she was working as fast as she could.

Hands down, my favorites are the potato pancakes, apple fritters - delicious.  The regular entrees are tasty, but the aforementioned are too good to pass up. The potato pancakes were crisp and not overly oily or heavy. The apple fritters were a first for me. I was expecting something along the lines of a huge doughnut like pastry and these looked more like dumplings. I was a bit skeptical about trying them, but they were tender, not overly sweet, and just way better than my doughnut idea. I wish I had taken a picture; I took for granted that BW has been open forever and someone would have taken a picture of them, but I didn't find one photo of these delectables - next visit! We also attended their special, Oktoberfest dinner, and opted to have the same server for our table again. We knew what to expect service wise, and again, she's just too nice and we couldn't say no to her when she invited us back.

The downside to Oktoberfest was that BW charges a fee just to have a seat. Sadly, I can't quote you the amount per person, but be aware that you pay a fee/cover charge, in addition to your bill for food and beer. We had schnitzel and sauerbraten. I love jaegerschnitzel no matter what and had never tried sauerbraten. So I was pleasantly surprised by the sauerbraten; it wasn't overcooked and the sauce/gravy was savory. I could see myself ordering this if I didn't want something breaded. I haven't had too much authentic German food, but I think BW has some great dishes that are homey/comforting. Plus, their linzer cookies are butter delicious. 

Do not pass up the opportunity to try the food and sweets here. I agree the service is slow, but if you go there expecting a nice, leisurely dining experience, you won't be disappointed.",2019-01-04 16:48:29

Given a choice between a large booth in the back or pushing together several tables in the bar area, we decided on the bar.  That made for a better time as people kept switching tables.  My wife and I ordered a bottle of wine and started off by sharing their spinach salad.  Which was as good as it was last time.  Our pizza was the house special which consisted of red sauce base with mozzarella cheese, and plenty of meat, pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, and bacon, along with mushrooms, black olives, Roma tomatoes, green peppers and onions.  I swapped a slice of the house special for a slice of the veggie special.  Not bad, but I think mine was better.

After grabbing the food from the back, you have to pay for it upfront. That guy, who is probably the owner was not friendly at all. He just took the money and that's it. We got Eggs Benedict and a Bacon Omelet and it came to about $23. Our food was very good. They give you  a lot of potatoes and they were crispy on top.

Do4aKR6upCBRUl0CUV0Xnw,5,"The Gallery Pastry Shop has been on my must-visit list for about a year now (if not longer). Sure, the crepes were a draw, but the menu, concise and inviting, was more alluring, as well as all the photos that seemed to be, well, everywhere I looked! 

After a few cursory visits to the patisserie, I finally made it out for brunch. I haven't been to too many brunches here in Indiana, largely because I spent almost none of my adult life here- the kicker is that I LOVE brunch. I love the ambience, the atmosphere, the idea of getting a relaxed start to the day and celebrating that start with good food and drink (because who needs hurried, pre-office breakfasts anyways), and of course, the bubbles.

My friends settled on mimosas while I can't turn down anything berry-flavored, so I settled on a sparkling lemonade (that I later shamelessly added some of their extra champagne to, of course). It was refreshing, spritely, and surprisingly, almost not sweet at all! 

While my croissant was a little too indulgent for my taste, the hashbrowns were absolutely divine, as were my others' friends orders of: Goose chorizo hash, bananas foster crepes, and a make-your-own omelet. 

The menu has so, so many things I'm left wanting to try and with a new Downtown location adorned with some fabulous artwork of Bourdain, there's absolutely no doubt I'll be one of the first customers.",2020-07-09 16:44:50

Nothing was warmed up, cold chicken, cold moussaka, cold falafel. We also were missing the baklava. We called to let them know the food was cold and we were missing the baklava. They explained that they cook all the food ahead of time and only warm it up for orders. There was no apology or move to try and make things right. They did refund the $5 baklava.

He also told me that he couldn't stop thinking about how much sex she must have had. Beyond the creepy comments, the haircut was not what I wanted at all as I told him to fade the side into the top which he completely ignored and shaved off all the hair on the side of my head down to the scalp. He also trimmed my eyebrows without asking me if I wanted that, which I would have said no to since I have had my eyebrows trimmed before and know that I do not like it. But he did not care to ask.

I'm a huge fan of the anime Fullmetal Alchemist, and I wanted to get a tattoo from the series on my left calf. When Phase 2 Guidelines reopened tattoo parlors, I filled out the inquiry form on their website with the piece I wanted. I called back the next day, and the receptionist took a look at it and told me that Cody Holler was more than excited to do it for me. I scheduled the appointment for the following Saturday. 

Immediately when you walk in, you'll see just how clean the establishment is. The receptionist was extremely friendly, and had me fill out a quick form before my appointment. I was nervous at first because I'd never done this before, but I got comfortable quickly seeing just how professional everyone was. 

Moving on to the tattoo, I can 100% say that Cody Holler is the man for the job! He knew exactly what I wanted, drew up a quick draft and before I knew it, we were ready to go. He is also a huge fan of Fullmetal Alchemist, and it was so much fun chatting with him about the different anime series we've watched. It made the time pass so quickly, and his artistic skills are out of this world. Super chill and down to earth guy.

-Could I really give 5-stars to Twisted Sprocket... the same number of stars I've given to Berns? Does it cheapen all of the amazing experiences I've had at world-class venues over the years if I'm handing out 5-stars to a place like this?

Well, here's my answer: everything must be graded on a scale. If your kid is a really great Little League baseball player, it can also be true that he would strike out every time if he were put on a Major League Baseball roster tomorrow.

For a fast-casual place to eat in the midst of a master-planned community, Twisted Sprocket is awesome. It would also be awesome if you put it in an airport. It's super convenient for those who live in Bexley. And it's a really nice surprise for any first-timer when they probably assume the quality of the food will be low-end banquet quality, at best. In reality, it was so much more than that!

I ordered steak quesadillas, a mango smoothie and a red velvet cookie. All of them were delicious! My wife ordered the club sandwich and it was also great.

Based on my one visit, I would definitely have faith that I could order just about anything here and it would be enjoyable. Plus, they serve Buddy Brew coffee, which means I would definitely be visiting somewhat regularly for that alone, if I lived in Bexley.

Kudos to a really great neighborhood incorporating another nice perk for their residents. But if you're like me and not a Bexley resident, you can definitely just pop in!",2021-05-10 14:35:23

My wife and I have been visiting Fitlife Foods just about every week for years. We do our best to eat healthy during the week and don't enjoy cooking, so it's been a Godsend. But with that many Fitlife meals in our rearview, we've gotten a bit tired of the options and felt like we needed a little break. I'd been wanting to try Dinner Done for a while now, so it seemed like the opportune time.

We've now eaten a handful of items and they have all ranged from good to great. We've tried bourbon chicken, loaded mashed potatoes, shrimp milano, meatballs, schnitzel, spaghetti and meatballs, pina colada cake and a few other things that I'm forgetting. I suppose the shrimp milano was my least favorite out of the group, but it was still a very solid meal. The bbq meatballs and loaded mashed potatoes was probably my favorite concoction.

We haven't participated in the cooking experience of what Dinner Done offers. With a newborn in the house, I don't foresee us having time to do that anytime soon, but maybe someday!

The only negative to Dinner Done is that I enjoy the meals so much that I end up eating well beyond a ""healthy"" portion every night. The portions are listed as for ""2-3 people, depending on hunger,"" so what happens every night is that I end up eating at least two portions worth, because what's left after we both eat never seems to be quite enough to save for leftovers. 

Just a heads up - these meals usually end up taking about an hour to cook + defrosting time. But it's still a heck of a lot more convenient than cooking everything from scratch!",2019-02-28 15:40:28

Yf0JwS-Zr2DQlk73TDzVLA,4,"This pub lies about three miles out of the way for those staying without a car in the airport interplex.  It's worth it if you can get out to Essington, right across from a shiny, clean Wawa. 

Many enjoy a good smoke or a drink outside in the patio.  Inside, it looks like an anonymous local bar you'd find in Smallville anywhere, too, but don't let that fool you.  I'm on a red meat avoidance program so I ordered the open faced turkey platter for pickup.  One of the servers immediately asked if I was there for takeout and I took my prize home in the relentless summer heat in minutes.  

The pale lifeless slices of white bread seem at odds with the flavorful gravy and piles of moist turkey breast heaped on top of them.  The mashed potatoes are great and I finished my messy meal with much satisfaction knowing I paid less than $10.  I hear the Philly cheesesteak at Monaghan's is melt in your mouth goodness, but don't know when I'll be out there again to test that claim.  A rare hotel recommendation earning the hype.

Personal photos of her and her hubby, and a little drawing her daughter Vivianne drew which I thought it was adorable to add in the store. The clothing is cute but with a little downfall.. a lot of things don't compliment girls with curves. Tiny clothing. I also think some of the employees acted like they were too cool because they work in JJD's store and have probably met her a few times so a couple of them were a little rude and acted like their shit didn't stink... which is why I gave it 1 less star.

I then couldn't find a product & asked one of them for help, the white guy pointed in a direction & that was it. The white lady asked for a product & the black guy rushed to help her find what she needed. Im so disappointed because I spoke to my neighbor who spoke so highly of this place. My money will be spent where I'm treated equally to other customers. Nothing in aisles are clearly marked so finding what you need will take a long time if you don't get help, which they aren't interested in doing. This happened both times I went to this place.

fBAoEWbN2mJYPEceDaCC6A,4,"Sylvain is a small, rustic eatery tucked away in the French Quarter right by St. Louis cathedral.  Located on a block that features retail and restaurants, one enters the establishment down a long, narrow ""alley"" that runs along the side of the main dining room.

Well worn wooden floors, exposed beams and dim lighting set the mood for this cozy dining room which features southern American fare.

The copper topped bar is a favorite spot because of the great service and the ability to spy all of the lovely cocktails they make.  Bloody Mary's featuring a pickled okra garnish are always a crowd pleaser.

There is additional seating in the courtyard which is just out back.  On cool spring nights it is tough to get a table out here but worth the wait.  Tropical plants and an older brick wall make it an inviting spot.

Open for lunch on Friday, dinner most nights and a brunch on the weekend, Sylvain always attracts a crowd.

Favorites on the menu include the Chick Sylvain sa which - a southern fried chicken breast served on a homemade bun with pickles - and fries.  Other favorites include the salads and shrimp with cornmeal dumplings and the hangar steak

I have since returned multiple times in the early morning to try the donuts. I can now say with confidence that they do have some great donuts. My favorite by far is the apple cider glazed. Plain glazed were decent and boston cream were delightful as well. I still wouldn't say they are #1 but they are definitely great, just as long as you get them when they are fresh.

That's about all that was positive about the experience. It took a long time for us to get our drinks and appetizer, even though there were maybe 4 other tables with people at them. The waiter basically never checked on us throughout our entire 1.5 hours there. We waited 45 more minutes to get our main course (three basic sushi rolls). Then, it turns out they got my order wrong and seemed to not care at all. During the entire time we ate and drank we were never checked on a single time, and we had to wait another 20 minutes after finishing our food for a different waiter (not even our own) to ask us if we needed help with anything. Our waiter seemed very short with us near the end even though we were very polite and casual with him the entire time, despite the poor service.

I hadn't been to a Sonny's in over five years and figured I'd give it a shot. I had to do a double take to make sure they were open due to the outside of the building looking straight out of the 90's. 

I walked in and was arguably the youngest person in there by 15 years. I sat down and took a look at their menu and was very impressed by their selection of lunch options. They offered a lunch special that included a protein dish, side item and drink starting at $10.

That's a good value for a BBQ joint. 

A server old enough to be my grandmother came over and took my order. She was very nice, but clearly not all there. I asked to add cheese to my pulled chicken sandwich to which she smiled and got my order over to the kitchen. 

My sandwich came out and there was no cheese on it. 

By the time she came by to check on me I was already finished with my mediocre sandwich. The sandwich wasn't as big as I imagined and it really didn't fill me up.

_EYzEAM8ZGAXhwPxgTNzQQ,3,"Stopped by and had a business brunch. Unfortunately, The Living Room on Main no longer offers the sensational Blue Crab Benedict that I absolutely loved. Based on that dish, however, I selected their newer offering, the Old Bay Crab Benedict. It was consisted of poached eggs, lump crab meat, applewood bacon, brie cheese, old bay hollandaise, on freshly baked biscuits. I did also find spinach and tomato. It was not bad. The hollandaise was very tasty and the eggs were done to perfection but this Benedict was nowhere near as wonderful (or as heaping) as the earlier Blue Crab Benedict (you can see a photo of that delicious monster below). I did actually appreciate that instead of a fruit plate, as was served with the Blue Crab Benedict, they included potatoes. Well, some potatoes. I, myself, would have preferred, for the price paid, about 50% more as they are not that expensive. The service was, as always, very good. Kept water and coffee full, and never felt rushed to leave, taking it from a 2 to a 3 star rating. I will probably go back as The Living Room on Main does offer some nice dishes that I had not taken the time to review the other 4 or 5 times I have visited over the past 4 years, but I will not be taking in the Old Bay Crab Benedict again. And, hopefully, they have not made much smaller portions of everything they offer as they did with this one.",2019-10-04 10:58:19
V-jiTqYCFl0Tdxg8cmx1NQ,3,"Stopped in for dinner and drinks on a Saturday night with a small group. Parking is sparse and valet takes up half the lot so we had to park across the street. The place is pretty nice on the inside and outside, with the exception of smokers ruining the pretty outdoor fire with their disgusting cigarette butts. Inside, there's a bench and some tables and bar seating by each of their two bars. Most of the people stand and drink though. A live band was playing inside near one of the bars and left it difficult to have a conversation. This bar area was also very dark, while the second bar area was actually pretty well lit.

First of all, I wouldn't really recommend this place for dinner. They are a bar/pub and should be enjoyed for their alcohol and bar bites, but not for a meal. Kitchen closes at 10, but there is still a ""bar menu"" available later.

I ordered the flatbread which was as expected (after attempting to order the pasta pesto dish without all the add-ins, but they couldn't hear my order details over the music, so I just went with the flatbread). My boyfriend's wings were just okay. Overall, I left still feeling hungry, and therefore a little disappointed. If we went here just for drinks, I'd have given them an extra star. But as a dining establishment, I didn't particularly enjoy them.",2018-03-25 15:30:29

YgpSr31bCAVTF2oKb8Eezg,4,"This was definitely a fun experience to do with a few ladies from work.  The whole experience was really enjoyable and pretty easy.

Prior to the event, when you sign up for the class, you review all of the projects you can make and choose it when you sign up. If you are going with a larger group and want to make sure you're sitting with each other, be sure to identify that at sign up.

The instructor was very easy to follow. They had a nice selection of paint colors and stains. I think the hardest part was getting some of the more complicated designs pulled off of the (unsure of technical language) backing and then making sure it was centered on the piece of wood. The foam paintbrushes were also a little dingy, so it was a little difficult to get the final paint on there, but made out just fine using the side of the brush.

The first round of drinks are complimentary. All others after that are $2.00.

Overall, I really enjoyed this experience! I do agree with one of the other reviewers that $65 is a bit much for this project and that, too, is why I am giving it 4 stars.",2019-01-27 19:35:54

I have literally gotten my whole apartment full of furniture at this place. I got a cute tall cabinet that i painted red, a really big gold framed mirror for $35, and a great retro living room chair.
If you like to do projects they have super bargains!  But they also have tons of stuff that is good to go as is.

TDQuFUn2r9_AWnzTj-Mh8Q,5,"Best dinner in New Orleans from start to finish. Loved that we were able to dine past midnight with no worries. Our server was very attentive  and polite even though we were the last table. One of our friends was lactose intolerant and the server was very resourceful in communicating between the chef and my friend some minor tweaks that could be made. 
    I had the berry mojito which was small but good. My boyfriend thought the mule he had was made well. Everything our table had was delicious. I enjoyed the fresh and hot complimentary  corn bread. I would say it was a tad bit too sweet to have a large piece though. 
    The fried oyster grill Caesar salad was  delicious! Could have easily eaten as a main dish and be satisfied. I thought the flash grill would make the lettuce wilted but it did not and gave the Caesar great flavor. Oysters were breaded and  fried to perfection. The gumbo had a good amount of heat,  and after my earlier gumbo fiasco at another restaurant, glad I got to sample some decent gumbo before I left New Orleans. 
   Tomahawk porkchop was huuuge and  cooked medium well spot on. The bacon braised green beans were the best tasting green beans I've had. Bread pudding is my favorite dessert so it was my priority to have sensational bread pudding at least once and rebirth nailed it with the white chocolate sauce and pralines.",2017-04-30 03:55:57

I will say the customer service here is pretty good, a lady who came through the car wash, ended up getting a flat tire, and instead of doing nothing and leaving her to figure it out on her own, they jumped right in and put the spare tire on for her, which I thought was extremely nice and the right thing to do.

The bathroom is always kept clean so I have no complaint there either. They do offer outdoor seating but it was too cold for us to sit outside.

I didn't mind waiting because the aroma of the fresh Cuban bread brought me back home and i could honestly stand there all there.

9yzin2X4I9el6s7wrFf83g,4,"Another place to add to my list of Take-Out during Covid. I believe this is my 6th time order taking within 2021-22. This was the day after New Years and I was craving sushi and my favorite sushi place is too far for takeout (and they are always too busy anyways). Ocean World is close to home and their sushi trays never disappoint. They are always so consistent with their food! The trays always look the same (we even ordered two one time and they look very identical) which I like because I know I can trust my next order to be as great. I love the variety if nigiri they give you and you can choose between three sushi rolls (or four - the fourth one has an extra charge) to order with the 22 pieces of nigiri. We almost always order the soft shell crab o2 roll because we like to have a balance of cooker and raw fish. As a side, you can choose between miso soup or side salad (they give you two so you can choose two misos or two salads or one of each). 

I'm leaving out one star because of their pick up process wasn't a fun experience. Every time I go to pick up, there's no one at the front. The last time I went, several of the waitresses made eye contact with me, but they found other things to be 'busy' and I'm sure it's because there's a hostess who takes care of incoming customers and pick up orders, but it would've been nice to know that if someone was coming up to the front. It looks like there us one hostess who sits people, but also us responsible for bring all the takeout orders out to the front so when there's multiple takeouts at one time, they wait to fill their cart and then come to the front. I waited 15mins until someone finally acknowledged me (and that was because there was a group coming in for dine in).",2022-01-12 20:29:14

eJnwyot0rLyWN84DwyC0RA,2,"I had been hearing about a nice African restaurant in West Philly, and I finally made it there to give it a try. Kilimanjaro restaurant is located in West Philly in the University area.  
 Killamanjaro is located in a strip mall with free parking,  however the lot was full and I had to park around the corner.  Even though I parked down the street and around the corner, immediately upon leaving my car I could smell the unmistakable spices of African food! On my way to the restaurant, I went into what the army calls a quick step.
 The aroma was intensified inside and I sat down in a quaint little dining room with high hopes. The server was a very nice young lady who brought me the menu. After looking over the menu it became clear to me that this was food from the country of Senegal, which is puzzling to me because Kilimanjaro is in East Africa.
 I had already tried many of the items before at other spots,  and one dish called Yassa Philly caught my eye. First I want to tell you that I never order anything that seems out of place and not authentic on a menu. To me its like ordering a Philly cheesesteak in Cheyenne Wyoming- You are rolling the dice!
 However I did not listen to that voice, and I sure wish I would've! 
 I ordered the Yassa Philly with beef, the presentation of the dish was beautiful. The plating of the meal was excellent, the rice, the vegetables and the Beef smothered in a spicy savory Yassa sauce. The rice was unmistakably African and the vegetables were cooked to perfection. But when I try to taste the beef, I couldn't cut it even with a steak knife. The cut of beef was so tough, with so much tended and gristle, my American teeth were no match for it.
 Just about then the server walked over to my table and asked how the food was. I told her that the beef is very very tough, she just nodded and walked away.  I really wanted to like this place, but how can you ignore a complaint like that and walk away? 
 Even though the beef came out caveman style, I would like to give it another try and stick to my old conventional criteria for ordering food.",2014-01-13 18:39:02

I have driven past Wild Bird Store several times, so I knew they existed but had never stopped in. When our Ace bird seed mold dwindled after a few days of gleefully watching birds on our patio, I suggested a trip to Wild Birds. We are in the process of landscaping our backyard, so we weren't ready to spend too much yet, but are gathering ideas and GOLLY do they have some good ideas here! We did buy a small finch feeder with a bag of thistle seed (as I'm writing this I just looked out the window to see that the finches have found the feeder!). The people working at the store are extremely helpful, and nicely enough they will just let you shop if you want too. They have a very nice selection of feeders, both ones made locally and commercially, and a wonderful assortment of bird seed in bulk, bagged, and molds made in shop (they have little wreaths for hanging if you're looking for a nice gift for a bird-lover!). I know we will be going back to this store regularly as we now have about 1,000 birds in our yard who are depending on us for their food supply...

Sat at one of the ""lower"" high tables, they aren't so bad, not like the real high ones. We were greeted immediately by one of the hipsters, and ordered.  Everything came out in a timely manner, but when I mentioned to the server that I thought the fries looked pale, like our first visit he poo pooed it and insisted they were fine, he had ""just seen them come out of the fryer"".  The wings were big, as all chicken is when pumped up with salt water to make them weigh more.

LHWtjTG7e1NzNPYUbUo-9w,3,"I'm a pretty big bagel snob, and when I find good bagels I get really excited.  I can't wait.  I seek them out, I savor them, and I really just plain enjoy them.  Part of my love affair with bagels is that I am a true carb head.  It's pretty sick how much I love carbs. But I digress. As a result of being a carb fiend / ny bagel snob, I feel like I know a good bagel when I have one. I recently stopped by South Street Bagels in an attempt to enjoy a good bagel. I really wanted to like them, but in the end, while their bagel was GOOD, I still think I prefer Four Worlds Bakery and the NY Bagelry out on Haverford Ave, even to some extent, Spread in Rittenhouse Square. 

Here's why: 

I went there early on a Sunday morning while running errands, really hoping to be in and out fast.  The place had a significant line, and they were NOT moving people along pretty quickly.  In fact, they had a number of people standing behind the counter NOT helping customers.  Secondly, the bagels, while many in variety, and all looking great and warm and coming out constantly (implying that they were in fact very fresh), were OKAY.  I ordered a sesame seed bagel with lite vegi cream cheese, instead got a sesame with plain cream cheese, and it was just plain okay. It wasn't fantastic.   It was a decently made bagel, but there was SOMETHING off about it.  I bought two, so I got to try it again the next day.  Toasted, it was good.  But again, not great.  It was a LITTLE too tough for my liking, and though they had just come out of the oven, they weren't nearly as soft and yummy as I had hoped they would be.  They also seemed to be too dense, and just not quite delicious.  

Verdict: it's a good bagel place to get a good bagel fix.  A tad overpriced, and the service is a little slow (if my experience was at all typical), and just plain okay. 

There are other bagel places around / in the city that I prefer.",2011-12-25 21:47:37
XvZ1zFYSfQOZqPe2TNf3PQ,3,"My wife and I decided to take a breakfast date to a new location. We Stumbled upon the Griddle that was fairly close to our home.

The location is large with a ton of seating, with that though, there was a several minute wait at the front as it was full. 

The menu is large and features a lot of different""home cooked"" special items. There is a note on the menu that says each speciality item has a story behind it and to ask the server for them. I declined to do this, but it's a cute idea. 

We opted for a build your own omlete and you know the rules we had to swap our toast for a pancake. I might be spoiled from other locations up charge so I was taken back by the 2.50 price. It's not unreasonable  for that price, but other locations have a cheaper up charge.

Pancake was fluffy and large, a bit doughy, and the syrup tasted great. The pancake was so heavy that it sits in your stomach. Definitely enjoyed eating the pancake, but afterwards you question your life decisions. The omelette was fine. Nothing special. Get 3 items for the cost, each item after that is 1.00. too expensive for me to get the omelette I wanted.

Opened from 7am-3pm. From my understanding there's always a line. Looks long but moves fast. Once you are in the building it goes quick. You have plenty of time while you are waiting in line to look at the menu. Your order at the counter and then they seat you with a number. 

Things to note: 
1. Mimosas are made with fresh squeezed oj and served in a highball glass which justifies three $12 per mimosa.
2. The Princess is ""hot chicken"" style, not actual Nashville hot chicken. It's delicious and pretty mild.

I ordered the Croque Monsieur with a side of tomato soup and my old lady ordered the Beef Angus with coleslaw. Now lets get to the food. 

Croque Monsieur- This bad boy is like a baked ham and cheese sandwich. It came with Havarti cheese, garlic sourdough bread, with mozzarella on top with a side of mustard and some delicious fermented veggies. The natural uncured ham went perfectly with the garlic sourdough bread. The veggies were also amazing and I loved how pickled they were as well. 

Tomato Soup- Usually I don't order soup but I was reading the numerous of reviews and everybody was talking about the soup. So I got the tomato soup and boy am I glad that I did.

I started with a bowl of their home-made tomato soup and WOW, was it good.  Creamy with chunks of tomato, perfect spices, accompanied by sourdough bread.  It was so big, I should have just gotten the cup.

For my entree, I opted for the 1/2 turkey Reuben sandwich, with Cole slaw.  The rye bread was perfectly toasted and the turkey was juicy and moist.  Add the perfect amount of 1000 island dressing, sauerkraut and plenty of melted Swiss and you have food bliss!  The accompanying Cole slaw was crisp and tasty; however, I prefer more dressing on mine as this seemed dry.

The other items ordered at the table included the chips/salsa (fresh and home-made), the lemon/artichoke soup (which was rich and tasty with a little tang from the lemon), the salmon sandwich, on Ciabatta bread, which was so huge it had to be attacked with a fork and knife!  Hubby said the side of Quinoa was the best he'd ever had.  Also appearing at our feast were the Elvis Liege waffle (which was an amazing improvement on a traditional Belgian waffle, and I loved the history about this waffle provided on the menu) and a Paleo bowl, which was HUGE and looked way too healthy and grown up for me, but the one who ordered it ate every bite!

Good service, a little slow on drink refills and forgot some stuff we asked for during the meal, but overall, not bad for a busy mid-day rush.

2yPEWWgTGUibS9j4VZiEOg,5,"How have I not reviewed this place yet ?? So I originally found KAHA through Groupon. It was a great deal so I thought I would give it a try because I really love group fitness classes and I saw they teach a variety of Les Mills classes here . I belonged to Planet Fitness at the time and it wasn't really giving me what I was looking for . 

One thing I will say about KAHA that sets them apart from other gyms is you feel WELCOME when you walk in the door . I have been to other gyms where it's like you are a peasant off the street who dared to enter their precious gym .. not the case here ! The owner, Monica, and the rest of the staff really make it a point to let you know they are happy you are there . 

After my Groupon expired , I ended up taking the plunge and signing up for a membership here ! And let me tell you, I have not once regretted it. I honestly have gained much more than I ever thought I would . KAHA has introduced me to two extremely important aspects of my fitness/health life that I was missing : strength training and nutrition . I knew I didn't have a clue what to do with weights ... but honestly I thought I had a pretty solid grip on nutrition . Turns out I did not . Haha! I thought of carbs as my enemy (which is not true I found out!) and I was getting less than half of the protein that I should've been . Who knew ? Although I was skeptical at first , with proper training in strength and nutrition I have seen incredible changes in my body. In 2.5 months I lost 5% of my body fat and gained almost 3 pounds in muscle!!

xalgcjscRLNPuyaAeKNThA,4,"This is a decent sized bar with patio seating, bar seating and dining room seating.  You must be 21 to enter, so you have to leave the littles at home.  They have a full bar, with beer and cocktails and run daily  lunch, dinner and drink specials. There are tons of TVs around the bar and dinning area and there is a stage off of the dining area where they host bands on the weekends.

They have a digital juke box and 5 or 6 electronic dart boards. There were some other games in there to play as well.  There are ample parking spots available in the private lot that it shares with the other businesses that they are in the strip mall with.

There food menu is compact, but still has something for everybody. There are salads, quesadillas, burgers, fish, wraps and chicken. I got the Sloppy Joe with fries and their reuben egg rolls as an appetizer. It did not take too long to get my food, I would say less than 10 minutes.

The food was good. It was not the best that I have had, but was far from the worst. It is your typical pub fare. It was warm and had flavor. I would get it again.

The staff there was ok. They were very busy. The place was packed. I am low maintenance, so I did not have much interaction with them. They could have been a bit more attentive though. For example, I came in looking lost and was never greeted or directed where to go. 

i do like this place and bet that they are all the way live on weekends. They have decent food and reasonably priced drinks. With the amount of tvs they have, this is a nice place to catch the big fight or game. They are almost guaranteed to have the event you want to watch, on.  I recommend stopping by and checking this place out.",2022-01-07 21:44:57

The pizza is heavy and will completely fill you up after 2-3slices. The cheesesteak melted in my mouth and that bread held everything together. The bread was soft in the inside and hard on the outside. The hoagie was so refreshing and on point! 

I had some leftover pizza/cheesesteak and gave it to my parents the next day. Even after reheating the food, they could not get over how delicious everything was. They both loved the bread so much.

The park is members only, and you have to pay a membership fee to become a member, but if anything I find it a lot better. it ensures that only dog owners who seriously care about providing their dog(s) with a good outside area are inside it. And this way someone meets all of the owners and their dogs before they are accepted as members. So it weeds out any overactive animal that might not behave well around the others, and any unpleasant owners.

Their handcrafted Empanadas are incredibly delicious, and with so many different tastes available. I am a total carnivore and am loving their vegetarian/vegan selections. 

The fun part is that with every visit there is something new to taste, and you can never go wrong. Starting the day with their Buen Dia (breakfast empanada) is perfect. Then at lunch their Carne, Serrano, Hongos, and a new favorite the Hakuna Batata. Their special Combos is always a nice choice too.

Good news is they are still there and still doing it right. Probably better. They took over more sidewalk a few years ago to expand outdoor space. And they certainly are not mailing it in based on their success based on my recent visit.

Mussel chowder was sublime. Just rich enough to be filling without leaving your tongue coated with that fatty feeling.

Shrimp grinder was a salty and flavorful stuffed baguette... with perfectly prepared shrimps. Tender. Delicious.

And by the way, the slaw ROCKS here. Add a touch of hot sauce and it's dreamy good.

Nice little beer selection including local craft brews, with Dixie and Abita offerings paying homage to Louisiana.

I was lucky enough to have lived down the street from Los Mariachis, so was able to take advantage of my location to try many different dishes. I was never disappointed. The chorizo is tasty without being too salty, the sauces and dips are fresh, the chips are amazing. The frijoles refritos are average, as well as the arrroz, but to be honest, I don't expect those things to steal the show.

My favorites are the chimichangas, the chorizo nachos, and the chips and salsa they serve to everyone. The salsa is a delightfully fresh experience that I encourage everyone to try. 

If you dig flan, try it here, I promise you will not be disappointed. The portion is huge, melts in your mouth, and will leave you wanting more.

Los Mariachis also carries a great selection of Mexican sodas. If you're into trying new drinks, I'd suggest starting with the Orange or Apple sodas.

The family running the place are very sweet and will answer any questions you have about a plate. Don't forget to check out the Guadalupe painting on the rear wall for a glimpse of a unique use of spray paint.

This is a great food alternative to all the yuppy  hangouts in Phoenixville, and totally worth the going the three blocks off of Bridge Street to enjoy.",2009-02-25 15:13:45

The low flow showerhead was a bummer, but not completely unexpected. My husband and I have resolved to bring our own showerhead and wrench next time we take a road trip.

Making up for the suckwad shower, however, was the massage chair in the room. I don't know if they have these chairs in every room or if I just won the golden ticket, but this chair was fantastic. It reclined, heated, and massaged my upper back, lower back and legs. After spending hours sitting in a car, it was greatly appreciated. I used it both in the evening and the next morning.

The food is well thought out, and amazingly displayed. Of course, everything tastes amazing! They bring out the flavors so nicely, and I'm not sure how they cream up their sauces, but they don't lack any richness. I thoroughly enjoy how the menu is designed -- it is in such a way that encourages you to try many things! I would say the one thing that is a drawback was how sweet my drink was -- I even let the ice melt, and it was still too sweet. 

The ambiance is great, casual enough for an after work rendezvous, but elegant enough for an anniversary dinner. The service is outstanding. The servers are very knowledgeable of every menu item, and it is worth consulting  them about what to order, if you don't already know what you want, that is!

zfD3xhVNkGJs-AOOSslqtQ,2,"Alas, poor Cork, I knew him well, but as K&K, I couldn't tell you the last time I spent so much money and was completely unsatiated. We'd been coming to Cork for years and liked the bartender, so OK, new look, new menu, same crew, same owner, wants to freshen things up a bit, sure, right? Wrong!

Tried a bunch of new things:
Bacon Nuts - served cold, too salty, entirely too spicy
""Amish"" pretzel w/ everything seasoning - too salty, entirely too buttery, tastes likes Auntie Anne's
Meat Plate - Zavino in Center City has ruined me with their awesomeness, meat was fatty, sliced too thickly, meat did not have good flavor, served with olives and bread drizzled with smoke-flavored oil
Tartare Fish Tacos - fish was stringy, cabbage was fresh lightly seasoned Napa, sauce was too spicy and hid the flavor of the fish
Beers - selection was good
Cocktails - new selections fun to try, but nothing I would order again

We only ate a quarter of what we were served, but weren't asked if anything was wrong. We weren't charged for the fish tacos, but only b/c the server forgot to place the order. 

I feel like they spent a ton of money fixing things that weren't broke. The area behind the bar looks like something out of someone's garage, rather than the cozy pub feel that Cork used to have. The bare filament lighting looks like someone's trying to make a statement rather than just be who they are. At least they don't make the bartenders wear bowties I guess. It makes me very sad to think that I will not be coming back. : (",2012-03-22 00:43:10

But I know it's authentic because it was delicious and my business associate, who has experience with German food, validated my thought. We stopped here for dinner on Thursday night. I decided on a nice 16 oz German beer, which was quite refreshing. Since this was my first time eating German food, I decided to take our waitress' suggestion and ordered the sampler platter. I was starting to feel full halfway through my meal. But it was so delicious that I needed to finish the entire plate! 

I heard very good things about the German Black Forest Cake, so we decided to order one and split it. Here is where they lost a star. The cake seemed like it had been sitting around for a while. We mentioned it to our waitress and they were good enough to take it off of the bill. They really should make sure that they are only serving the freshest food items, as it makes all the difference. 

Overall, the decor, food and staff create a truly authentic German experience!",2016-11-05 12:58:45
iuEYxx6_XR1JYoCYMS5K_A,1,"I was walking around downtown yesterday after lunch and decided to pop in for a look since I've never been. I've lived downtown for almost 2 years and never been in this place since it's kind of off the beaten path. Also, I think it's important to mention that I chose to shop locally over the holidays and not ONCE did this place pop up during any of my searches for local finds in Boise.

Yedterday, right after walking in I was treated rudely by the woman behind the counter. She had a dark short bob haircut and I believe she was wearing glasses. I honestly wasn't going to leave a review until I happened across their Instagram account today. Their post yesterday explained why they as a small business are requiring masks by their patrons, even though there is no mandate, and asked people to #bekind. I think they need to practice what they preach. With our city growing and so many new people coming to the area, you think they'd be kinder and more welcoming.

I will NEVER go to this place again, masks or no masks, solely because of  their hypocrisy. I don't think they can afford to continue with the bad behavior . The locals can only keep you in business for so long. It's the new people in this growing city that will keep you thriving, but not with their ugliness.

All the different types of glass and colors were so pleasing to the eye that I really loved this museum. Definitely take the time to go here.

1MwoiUajN2l54d4K9uTycA,5,"If you read my reviews regularly, you'll understand that the NMT has had some struggles in the past few years. Recently his doctors recommended he start medical marijuana, and it has been a huge help to him.  As in, just short of transformative.  It's not a fix-all, but it has given him enough of an improvement to come off some medications with scary side effects, and overall he's in a better place.

I will also say the cannabis you get in the dispensaries is not what has been available illegally.  The quality is higher, more consistent, and very highly engineered, with different combinations of THC and CBD for different issues, along with different formulations.  I am impressed.

Unfortunately, the combination that has been working best for the NMT also works really well for lots of other people, so it's in super high demand.  This means I basically stalk the different dispensaries, looking for it on their 'menus'.  This is how I came to be at Cure as they opened up one morning.  

This is controlled access, as expected, with a sleek, modern feel.  I was greeted warmly, my card taken, and pretty quickly headed back to the secure dispensary area.  One of their employees, super nice and also knowledgable, helped me with the strain I was looking for and also another that might work about as well (it does, not 1:1 match, but it will do when the preferred strain isn't available).  

The place is clean, bright, the staff is approachable and friendly and knowledgable.  Cash Only - all the dispensaries are cash only, if you didn't know that.  Why? For the same reason you can't use your AMEX to buy from the street - cannabis is still (for now) illegal at the federal level, and banks follow that set of laws.  They have an ATM on site, there's also a Bank of America branch on the same block and a Bryn Mawr Trust branch right across the street, so you have options to possibly avoid fees.  

Of course I'm going again, when the menu shows his best-working strain, but I'd also go because it's a pleasant experience to be there.",2018-11-21 18:31:45
VspP8zMI87c6O0Eh30rX-A,3,"I'm honestly surprised that a place that is called donut bistro actually sells Vietnamese dishes as well. 

I had dinner with my family and it was my first time coming here. It's a small establishment located on the corner of a shopping plaza and from the first look at it, you would not expect for this place to have a wide menu option. Their food ranges from Vietnamese dishes such as pho, vermicelli dishes, spring rolls, etc. They also have shumai, pork buns, and tarp buns. They offer boba and of course, donuts! 

I ordered the #1 which comes with rare beefsteak, beef flank, beef tendon, tripe and meatballs. The serving size was bigger than I expected which was also worth the price of 8.95. Definitely getting a bang for your buck with the amount of food you get. I was very disappointed with the taste though. The broth was very bland and watery. The bean sprouts that come on the side looked a little old and it tasted how it looked when I put it into my pho. We also ordered the pork and shrimp spring rolls which were good, along with their dipping sauce. They have a thick peanut sauce which was very yummy. 

We also ordered pork and shrimp shumai. It had more flavor to it for sure and I did like the dipping sauce that it came with. One order had 10 pieces which was a good amount. It was however a little on the salty side but it was still good. 

Lastly, we ordered the sweet & sour chicken and fried rice. This was also a decent item. Some of the pieces of chicken were a little cold which was very unpleasant and the fried rice was lacking some flavor. 

I'm not sure if I just came on a bad day, but I did leave pretty disappointed with the outcome of our meal. Still debating if I would come back to see if they will redeem this experience or just leave it as is.",2022-01-14 17:12:13

y6v0WKg8pcQAYMjYJE1cxg,3,"2 Stars for Value - $24 for Ravioli and $24 for Bucatini Amatriciana were, in reality, belonging to the $14 entree price range. The bread and salad portions are super small. It makes you feel terrible about the money you just spent.

3 Stars for Food - I'm surprised they're known for their Amatriciana because it was full of clumsy, undercooked Roma tomato chunks. At least use San Marzano tomatoes when charging $24, not a tomato akin to a mayonnaise sandwich or pico de gallo. The pancetta was crispy, therefore the sauce was just very disappointing and not something that was cooked thoughtfully. The ravioli were filled with a mushroom variety that had a bad aftertaste and the amount of oil was just too much.

To-Go Packaging - the cheapest aluminum containers with flimsy plastic tops are used where oil is pouring out all over your white paper bags. It was all over our car seat, then all over our hands and legs.",2021-03-14 17:10:41
5FumE6Y4YHYZFk3WVGkpYA,1,"8 years ago, Dave Moreale the president of the company came out to check out my AC that wasn't cooling well. He said I needed a new unit (of which I agree) and he had a deal on some. I arranged for them to replace both my ""moldy"" air handler and compressor. My first mistake was not making sure he was replacing the unit with a heat pump which when we built the house is what was installed. My fault for not making sure I was getting what I thought I was. The real rub was the people who came out really did a crappy job installing it. Every tech that has come out since looks at the system is amazed at the install. For example there is a small compartment in the unit for the excess electrical wires to go into. They left them hanging out loose ""to make future servicing easier"" so there was a massive tangle of loose wires just hanging out (I put the in a blue electrical box mounted to the unit). The unit also isn't properly leveled.  The unit should tilt slightly down towards the drain pipe to facilitate draining. Instead it is tilted 1/4"" the opposite way so it doesn't drain right. There are also dips in the drain line where it wasn't supported correctly. It is visibly crooked and the supports were not adjusted so it appears to be sagging. One thing that also dawned on me is a permit was not pulled for the work which would have necessitated an inspection. 

Three lessons learned that apply everywhere:
1. Make sure you are clear in what you want and make sure that's what you are getting
2. Make sure a permit is pulled. The process is to protect the homeowner.
3. If the work looks stupid even though it seems to work fine have it checked out immediately.

Some people have had good luck with them, unfortunately I don't consider myself one of them and as such can't recommend them.",2016-06-10 22:57:18
OpVo6uoypyDGIuGiGrwLEw,5,"After shopping along Philadelphia's Jewelry Row, we stopped for lunch at Pamir Grill Kabob based on past yelp reviews of 4.5 out of 5.  

Pamir Grill lived up to their reviews.  Delicious!  

We started with appetizers of Bulanee Gandana, a thin, crispy fried turnover filled with leeks and scallions served with a slightly spicy cilantro sauce much like hari chutney.  The potato filled Sambosa were equally delicious and well-seasoned.  

For my entrée, I had the Beef Kofta Kabob which was served with bread, rice and a simple salad with a tangy yogurt based dressing.  The kofta was seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly and was hot and delicious.  Slightly crispy exterior, fragrant, spiced and soft interior - perfect!  

My dining partner had the lamb kabobs and they were served with the same accompaniments and were as delicious.  

I had several cups of black Afghan tea and finished with Firnee (Firni) for dessert.  Pamir's firnee was reminiscent of Chinese doufu hua in that the custard was like soft barely formed curds.  An Afghan version of paneer kheer or sweet custard served chilled sprinkled with ground pistachios.  

The proprietress was friendly, attentive and the food was truly delicious!  

For those whom it is important, the food is halal.

  Drinks - I already had coffee at home so I stuck with water.

  Appetizer - none

  My Main Course - Today's hash came with beef tongue.  Every element was good, but it was not a hash to me.  The scrambled eggs were served top of the hash browns and beef tongue.  I got my daughter's order of sausage and it was a dry chorizo which she did not care for.  Chris had indicated that they make this in house and I enjoyed it very much.  Robert also bought the ramen for the group and it was very good but I have a hard thinking about ramen for breakfast.  Chris explained it was homage to Chinese workers that helped build the community.

  Dessert - none.

Service - Chris was the manager and was already with Robert and Ly when we got there.  It was great talking with him and learning about the plans of the restaurant and other Mark Estee business plans.  There were eleven of us and I know that is a challenge.  And there were multiple checks.  It started well with our waitress coming back around after getting every ones orders.  The food came out and I ended up with Robert's plate, today's special was a scramble.   This was corrected after I asked our waitress about it.  Next thing I know I had to make room for some sour dough toast.  I know I did not order it so I asked about.  She indicated that it comes with the meal.

YrlNGnrofZHseVYxrLrvJA,4,"Ive been meaning to try this place for years, but have so many favorite restaurants in this town that I kept putting it off. I made it in for an early lunch and am glad I did. First impressions were of a truly beautiful space, with warm dark wood and tile floors giving it a brasserie feel. This is a large restaurant, and can feel cavernous when it's empty, but the hostess sat us on the patio, which is more intimate. Our usual starter at a seafood restaurant here is oysters on the half shell, and these were very good. One of my pet peeves here in New Orleans is getting oysters with muddy shells. I'm really not a fastidious gal, but when you put that shell up to your mouth and get a bunch of dirt? Yuck. Not only were these oysters great quality, but someone took the time to scrub them and shuck them properly, so there we no bits of shell. I appreciate that, and will return for more.

It being a Monday, I had their red beans and rice, which were good. Not the best I've had, but serviceable. I also tried the fried oyster salad, which was petite but tasty, with a really nice Dijon vinaigrette and perfectly fried oysters. We ended our meal with the bread pudding, which was more like a spice cake than a true bread pudding, but which was delicious none-the-less. The cup of decaf they served me had an off taste, so I would skip that next time. Maybe the regular coffee is better.",2016-01-16 15:54:09

So, it's a known fact that the wait is insane, even during the week.  Since we planned to do brunch on Sunday, I used the waitlist feature on Yelp and put my name on the list. At 10am the wait was 50-70 minutes .....shout out to the waitlist. 
Got there and checked in at 10:50, still had to wait for 15-20 minutes. That flew by...it helped that they have someone outside to take drink orders. Sangria to the rescue. We were seated, and greeted fairly quickly. Though our sever was a little MIA. The place was uber packed, so she gets a pass.
The food....yes lawd!  We both decided on the gulf fish st peter. It was phenomenal!!! Drum fish, sautéed spinach and tomatoes over grit cakes topped with hollandaise and a shrimp skewer. The bill was $36, without the sangria. I'd definitely return.  Next time I'm getting the banana french toast.",2017-02-20 03:16:37

The server was friendly, and the coffee was still delicious. I don't think it's possible to have a bad drink here. The flat white is still my favourite. But I ventured out and had a delicious iced coffee instead. No cream or sugar required, the coffee is that tasty. 

Downside - no wifi here, at least none that I could get. Also they're closed on weekends. Really this place should be open all the time. You never know, it could by 3am and you start craving good coffee. And Tim Horton's just doesn't make the cut any more.",2011-05-10 06:25:01

Breadbasket is divine - breadsticks, lard bread, focaccia, peasant bread served with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and two types of butter -- regular and sun dried tomato.  
Signature cocktails are sweet and boozy. 
Fried Calamari - was golden brown not greasy with fried herbs and onions -- nice touch. 
Duck with mushroom risotto - perfectly cooked duck (medium rare) with creamy risotto

Food: fries were ok, a little soft/soggy. star tots were good. hotzerella sticks were definitely hot!Note, they have jalapeños in the breading! Hot, but also tasty! If it's too hot, try dipping in sour cream instead, then it's more like a popper. and the biggest hit was the Bag of Dicks which are chocolate churro sticks with cream inside and you get an oreo cream to dip them in, and they come hot!! YUM! 
Drinks: good options on the specials menu, and a long bottles/can list... but beware, they are often out of many of these options. Also serve wine. And most prices are GREAT at $5-~$8 per beer!
Music is nice, they have a jukebox, but at times it can be a bit loud and hard to converse.

The manager, Monina, has a wonderful phone personality. Once she understood I was stiffed on my reservation at my regular branch, she jumped in to get me a vehicle with no notice. In moments she found me a vehicle and my options for my day out expanded to the possibility of great adventures in shopping.

The driver, Mike from Ethiopia, picked me up at home. A great conversationalist, we covered the secrets of injera (the ubiquitous Ethiopian bread that underlies every meal) and the coffee ritual that frames their most delicious beans. I spent thrice the amount of time with Mike than I expected because my wallet fell out of my pocket at home, which I discovered once at the rental branch, so he took me back home and then back to the agency. Smiles all around.

This is what customer service ought to be like. This is what builds customer loyalty. Thank you for being awesome, Monina and Mike and Sim.

I've been a fan of Yummy House since moving back to Tampa Bay in 2010. Here I've met friends and introduced Justin to my family for the first time. It is the kind of place that you should have such meaningful gatherings at. 

Dim sum is such a great concept. Who doesn't love the idea of the cart sailing over to your table and you being able to pick out little containers of delectable dishes? What I also appreciate is that Yummy House has dim sum hours until 245p- for those who don't lunch early!

My favorite dishes are the bbq pork buns, taro cake and beef rice rolls. Luckily all of these are always available here.

Going here took me back to my childhood.

There is truly so much care that goes into making the food here, and you can tell in the high quality of each item.

Maybe one day I'll explore the menu further.  The corn and shrimp bisque is nicely flavored.  My wife likes the eggplant Harahan, a combination of eggplant medallions and crab cakes.  On the most recent visit she shared a boiled seafood platter with our guest.  There was an amazing amount of food on it for the price ($25); a pound of snow crab legs, 4 medium crabs, a pound of shrimp plus potatoes and ears of corn.  They had a great time eating it.

0LyHQfXVJ5WT334K-odKoQ,4,"I am reviewing the gym from a strictly non-class point of view. Let me review the place floor by floor:

I used to swim, and the pool is a standard Olympic-size one with ordinary showers, locker rooms, and towels. Nothing to see here.

The first floor has truly benefited from the renovation, the ellipticals and treadmills are all packed and for good reason. I personally prefer the erg machines, but they could always add a couple more.

The second floor multipurpose room with the large mat (for stretching and core exercises) used to be my stomping ground, but it's always too packed for my liking. Also the punching bags disappeared at last visit, and the plyo boxes are a little uneven. In addition, the basketball courts are insufferable in warm weather...ventilation please!

I'll skip a floor and talk about the fourth. It's perhaps the best kept secret about the gym. Once up the stairs make your way past the Zumba class and you'll find a pretty awesome iron gym with pull-up bars, kettlebells, and even a heavy rope. There's also a single erg machine, cardio machines, and a dumbbell rack. The secret's out.

For all the Penn kids out there, make the most out of this campus gym. You're already paying a recreation fee, might as well enjoy it and get the bod you want.

To celebrate a bachelorette weekend, a group of six girls and I made a reservation about a week in advance for a Thursday evening dinner at 6 PM. When we arrived, our vaccination cards were checked and we were brought to our gorgeous table in the back outdoor courtyard space. 

Our server was phenomenal, she walked us through the menu and recommended eating family style. This is my preferred way to dine always, I want to optimize the things I'm able to taste without getting too full so family style is always the preferred method for me, but others at the table are picky so they were hesitant. Since it came at our server's recommendation, we went for it. 

We ordered the crispy brussels and crab croquettas to start. For our mains we had the Arroz Con Pollo, Ropa Vieja, and a Cuban Roasted Pork dish. Everything was delicious, especially the chicken. The brussels were a hit, with two anti brussels sprouts eaters at the table.

The cocktail menu was extensive, with lots of great tequila and mezcal options. I had a specialty frozen paloma and loved it!

RKPkxOYQlM0BjhM-H6_vAw,4,"This is graded on a sliding scale, since obviously this restaurant would be a joke in Manhattan, etc. but for decent Chinese and fake Japanese with a touch of health consciousness in the suburbs, look no further than Golden China.

They have a popular lunch buffet which serves all the staples but mixes it up with some creamy rolls.

I ordered from the menu and did some vegetarian rolls, a delicious vegetable and bean curd soup (highly recommended), and some edamame.  They use fake wasabi and low-grade ginger, but the rolls were otherwise fresh and made in the traditional maki fashion (seaweed paper on outside), which was a pleasant shock.  Service was very attentive and accommodating.  There is a ""healthy"" section to the menu.  

The decor is bog-standard Chinese joint with a touch of suburban boredom instead of Disney-esque macabre China.  It's been about 5 years since I've last visited Golden China prior to writing this review, and they still haven't fixed one of the broken doors out front which seems to be jammed shut.

I decided on a equal mix of the vanilla and blueberry flavors. Great combo! If you aren't sure on what flavor you'd like, they have small sampling cups. are more toppings than I care to list - but if you want fruit, they've got it. Chocolate? You bet. Sprinkles? Well by golly, of course. 

There's plenty of parking by the new Depot apartment complex. Yogurtz is a few doors down from Brixx, so very easy to find. And if you're simply driving down 116th St., you'll be sure to see it. Great little spot for your froyo cravings!",2015-08-10 01:25:15

I would die for that cake, and I don't even particularly like cake. All the servers were on their A game-- smiling, filling up water, checking if we were ok, and taking empty plates. 

There's so much variety on the menu-- from tacos and empanadas to pizza and baklava. Everything sounded amazing and I think it'll take quite a few trips to Santa Barbara to try everything. The prices are quite high, but when you're the best you can charge what you like.

We were referred to this shop from USAA insurance and we are so extremely disappointed in our experience at this business. We would absolutely NOT recommend Tri-County Auto Glass Experts to anyone who values their vehicles or their time. If I could give negative stars, I would. 

On his day off, 11-8-2021, my husband took my car to Tri-County Auto Glass Experts get a simple windshield replacement. Unfortunately I was unable to go as I had work that day. When it was time to pick up my car, my husband was shocked to see that my right front tweeter speaker had been knocked out and wires were exposed. My husband was FaceTiming me so that I could see what was going on, and when he brought up the damage to the employee, Juan, my husband was berated and he was called a liar! Juan became defensive, argumentative and insulting and claimed that the speaker was already like that. This is completely false and extremely insulting. It had NEVER been like that. It had never even been slightly loose. My husband also discovered additional paint chips around my windshield and scratches to the interior. To add insult to injury, Juan claimed he never even opened the car door at all to install the windshield (this is in fact 100% not possible so it's evident Juan is the liar). Juan and the other employee there continued to act condescendingly toward my husband, called him a liar, and forced him to leave the establishment before anything was resolved and without getting a proper receipt with proof of their so-called lifetime warranty. 

Before coming to Yelp, we tried working with this business to give them a chance to rectify the situation or at least treat us with some decency and respect. In a disgusting turn,  the business owner, James S. Budow, has now gone so far as to accuse us of ""scammy"" behavior - all because my husband was FaceTiming me to show me the damage. So watch out if you want to take pictures or videos of your cars while you're there, you will be labeled as a scammer and be called a liar. The owner, James S. Budow, also told us that he encourages his employees to get their work done quickly so they can close up early and go home. This was the excuse in response to us questioning why they made my husband leave and why our car was damaged. The employees wanted to go home early. So if you want to be treated decently and have your car taken care of properly and not be damaged, go somewhere else where they will not be cutting corners to clock off early.

This business advertises ""lifetime warranty"" on their work and glass they install, however after our experience it is very clear that this is nothing more than a deceptive business advertising practice. The owner, James S. Budow, and the employees at Tri-County Auto Glass Experts do NOT respect people, much less military veterans, and they do not respect people's vehicles.

GmzkFUeiyHcxHb0lB-HaHw,1,"I made an online appointment to take my SUV in for service including oil change, cabin filter and air filter replacement, and state & emissions inspections for April 6. I had made this appointment 3 weeks in advance, and I had informed them that I would be waiting for the car. I included my cell phone number, and my e-mail.  I took my car in for the scheduled appointment in the morning, and when I walked into the service department, there were 3 people behind the counter, but no one showed interest in assisting me (that should have been my first clue of the horrible service to come). I was then assisted by service consultant Mercedes Vega. She wrote me up, and told me that I will have to drop the car off, but I mentioned to her that I specifically stated to them that I will wait for the car when I filled out the appointment online, and that they had my phone # as well as my e-mail in case that was not possible, but they never contacted to to let me know that I could not wait. She still insisted that I could not wait in the waiting room due to covid, at which point I informed her that I will not wait out in the street for a couple of hours until the car was done.  She finally agreed to have me wait in the waiting area but with an attitude.
After about a couple of hours of waiting, she comes in the waiting room telling me that I have a bad leak in the rear differential, as well as a couple of other issues. She made it sound that it was a heavy leak and it was urgent to fix, so I agreed to have  them to fix the differential leak. After waiting for another hour and a half, I decided to go and find out about the status of the work. She was on the phone, and when she saw me, she said that the car was not ready, and when I tried to find out as to when I will be finished, she started yelling at me telling me that she's very busy, and that she has no time to check, but it should be another 20 minutes. The question is: Why did she tell me that I had this urgent issue to fix if they did not have the time to do it. She knew that I was waiting, and she should have asked me to make another appointment. In any case, I went back to wait, and finally, she tells me that the car was done. Now here is where the Faulkner Nissan rip off comes into play ( besides the bad attitude, and the yelling at the customer ). They charged me $49.95 for the Emissions test even though I was ""emissions exempt""  and $151for fixing the rear differential leak.
Since that day, I have noticed that my rear differential fluid now is leaking in my garage, which I have not noticed before I took my car to Faulkner Nissan, so not only did they charge me $49.95 for exempt emissions, and $151 for supposedly fixing a rear differential leak, but now, it is really leaking where it was not before.
It would be nice if any manager at Faulkner Nissan who gives a damn about customer service to inform his service people to never yell at customers, but to be courteous.
I only wish that the Pennsylvania consumer protection office would look into Faulkner Nissan's deceptive and fraudulent business practice.",2021-11-11 16:32:45

There was nothing really too flashy about the joint.  They had a pool table and darts.  They have an outside covered smoking area which also houses a funny car and a large cage of some sort (a human would fit in it).  It was easy to find parking and best of all we cold hold a conversation without having to scream.

The food was pretty good.  My wife and I got two cheese burgers, two baskets of fries, and cheese sticks for $8.75.  However, the menu is just standard bar food, nothing really stood out as unique.

ME:  ""OK, can I sit here and apply for my own Sam's club membership and then buy the car with the Sam's club price?""

SVC MGR:  ""Yeah sure...""

So I did.  And while I did... They raised the price by $900.

I walked out - you should never walk in!

Today they called back to ask if I'd ""thought about"" buying the car.  

ME:  ""Yes, I have, and I'll buy it now for the original Sam's Club price.""  

THEM:  ""You can't get that price because I think there's a waiting period on your new membership before you can get...""  

ME:  ""You can stop right there.  The price is now changed even when my girlfriend logs on, even though her offer supposedly doesn't expire until three days from now.  This is no way to do business.""",2021-07-12 21:06:35

All 3 were outstanding but the squid and Brussels were tied for first. The sauces that both of them came in were amazing. For entrees we had the NY strip steak and the kale duck ravioli. Both were excellent. The ravioli were an unusual shape and they burst with flavor when bitten in to. The duck that came with the ravioli literally melted in our mouth. The steak was a perfect medium rare accompanied by tasty broccoli and potatoes. The chocolate custard and ricotta dessert was fantastic. We'll definitely return.",2016-05-16 18:02:24

From what I could see it looked like they did a thorough and complete job, answered all of my questions and addressed any issues that I saw that needed attention. There was a project manager who called to introduce himself once the workers arrived at my home and who stopped by to talk with me in person and hand me his card for any questions that I may have during the project. Although this is a very expensive project, I feel that if any issues arise I will be able to call them and get an immediate response as I have in the past with my eight windows that they replaced about six years ago and a sliding door they replaced two years ago.",2016-08-17 01:16:04

NCmYEc-DpJlYF1Lz0kT8KQ,2,"Underwhelming. My friend is a big fan of Flatbread so he wanted to try this place. First thing we noticed was a glass milk jar on the table filled with water and capped with a plastic top. We didn't know if it was there to refill our water or if they were going to put flowers in it and hadn't gotten around to it.  
For our entrees, we ordered the $15 French Dip and the $12 Crispy Chicken Sandwich. The French Dip was described ""prime rib slow roasted nightly - thinly sliced to order"". The meat was overcooked, curled up, and didn't look like it was ""sliced to order. The Crispy Chicken Sandwich was hardly that. The ""crunch"" had fallen off the chicken, leaving a soggy breading on my bun, revealing a cooked chicken breast. Also, there were no condiments served with the sandwich, just cole slaw and a tomato. There was no salt and pepper on the table and we had to ask our waitress twice for them. ""Oops I forgot"", she said with a smile (basic table items). Also, we asked for ranch dressing to dip our fries in and they came back with a watery dressing. 
The table was supplied with only two forks and napkins. No knives were provided upon delivery of our entrees, leaving us up to shaking the horseradish spread onto the French Dip (we did ask for knives and finally got two). 
Summary: 
Cons: Overpriced, average food, no better than Shari's. Poorly set dining table, unprepared for diners. Inattentive servers. 
Pros: The fries were good, and the ""buspersons"" were prompt when asked for something.",2019-10-08 16:54:27

We walked around checking out different vendors, went to the lower level and in the back. Some of the stores looked unkempt and in some areas of the market looked like a fire hazard. The places to eat were sort of the same; burger places, diners a couple Korean style places. We ate at the Grecian Delights (reviewed that one). We were there for about an hour and I really didn't see anything that would want to make me come back.

We headed in and got our tickets, which were $24 per adult. You can find $2 off coupons at places that have tourist pamphlets. You'll receive a wrist band and have access to both the museum and the garden. We were able to visit while they were doing the Disney and Dali museum. It was an excellent exhibit and we loved it!

The overall museum was just as great. They have a huge range of Dali's paintings from the beginning of his career to the end. It was fascinating to see the progression and to be able to watch the art evolve. We opted for the free audio tour - which I highly recommend as it was informative and dove into details on a good amount of the paintings. 

After we finished up the finished up in the museum we headed down to the first floor and adventured in the garden. The giant mustache makes for an epic photo op and the labyrinth was a fun walk through experience.

The gift shop has tons of fun items and we ended up with a cute magnet that was a view of the outside of the museum itself. Prices were very decent.

For me the best process was that they offered free deliver for the bed, and were able to haul my old bed away with no charge as well. That was a great sale for me. 

Adam was very knowledgeable on the beds and how other customers have experienced them. I also really liked that it's a family owned and local business, and they were able to bring the price down to the lowest they could sell it for.

We ended up getting the meat pie appetizers, six to a plate. They were decent enough. Pastry was hard but the filling was tasty enough to make up for the crust.

iEhpkdXhqA6ozUBwKYPPPA,4,"Today is my sister's birthday, so it's the day to go vegan. 

First impressions? To be honest, I hate the decor. It's pretty minimal, both in color and artwork. The walls are white and wood paneling. The booths are charcoal grey, and there's a few dull gold accents. For me it's a cross between stark and bleah, but I'm sure someone will tell me it's tasteful and contemporary. I halfway suspect it's so you'll decide to take your food to go.

BUT, atmosphere isn't nearly as important as flavor, and do these flavors ever pop!! I had the vanilla bean latte, (robust) and the Sloppy Joe. The Sloppy Joe was actually a tidy and delightful sandwich with beans, tomato and avocado. The thing that struck me was how delicious the bread was. I could taste the multiple grains and it was so soft and fresh. Nice decent portion too with a few tortilla chips. 

My sister had the falafel, and I can see why she enjoyed it. Again, very fresh, with singing flavors. She also had a mango mojito smoothie. THAT was interesting! Not my thing, but I swear it tastes like summer. Like sunning in your backyard next to the freshly mowed lawn, drinking something cold and fruity.

Dessert was a chocolate chip cookie for me, and an Eat More square for my sister. The cookie was okay, but I'm thinking I should have had the square. THAT was moist and yummy.

RlnqZVl2swWXm9KCQaHHSQ,3,"Randomly walked into this place after exploring the Saturday market in downtown Boise. It's a nice, little coffee shop located on the corner of 8th and Broad Streets.

I ordered gluten-free pumpkin chocolate chip muffin ($3.50) and white chocolate mocha ($4.20, 16oz).

Nothing particularly remarkable about my experience. Food selection was okay. Muffin and chocolate mocha were good. Service was alright. I did love the ambiance. A little cramped but charming. There's a nice outdoor patio that would be perfect for hanging out with friends on a sunny day.

Given that I ordered chocolate mocha and that apparently this place is known for its coffee, I'm going back to give it another shot (and will order coffee next time). But based on my experience, it's three stars for now for Caffe d'Arte. Here's my point distribution:

Food (40%) = 3
Service (30%) = 3
Ambiance (20%) = 4
Value for Money (10%) = 3

Overall score = (0.40*3 + 0.30*3 + 0.20*4 + 0.10*3) = 3.2 (round down to 3 stars)",2019-12-23 22:37:24

txBJRVbzeiTThHBnJ2Lxgw,4,Decent a Chinese restaurant in the Tampa area! I was visiting Tampa and was craving some authentic Chinese food. I ordered a wonton soup and Yang Chow fried rice. The wonton soup was perfect and really hit the spot. There was also a good amount of wontons! I also enjoyed the fried rice. It wasn't overly salty and the portions were huge. I ordered takeout and was amazed at how nicely everything was packaged. The food was ready in 10 minutes. I would visit this place again if I ever visited the area!,2021-12-14 03:05:04
kFRCeZhlEqtG_yJshA--0g,2,"I've been here over seven times, and I've only liked the drink once. They have way too many options and none of it is listed on the menu. The Doesn't always explain what drink is in the photo so when you go to order it the barista either guesses on how to make it or doesn't really know. 

There are simple things that could be fixed to give this hut more stars however some thing as simple as not wanting whip cream on the drink never gets done correctly. (I've asked for no whip several times and received whip cream every time, and they never offer to scrape it off or remake it) one time they even confirmed at the window that i did not want it and still handed me the drink with whip. 

Most of the time the barista's are really friendly so they have that going for them. But honestly most of the time the line is just really long and not worth

They are also out of things sometimes, today was oat milk. Last time we saw a barista carrying in bags of ice and gallons of milk. So they'll get a barista to bring things in. Which is fine, but just so you know because if they're out of something they'll have it back in a few hours",2020-07-06 16:28:27

My daughter had a grilled cheese.  I think the best thing about the restaurant was their icthysaurus bread.  A homemade country style bread with a nice crisp crust and chewy interior.

They had about 6 different kinds to choose from when I went in the afternoon and we picked the everything bagel and London fog ones. Majority of their donuts were also vegan so they're perfect for plant-based friends! 

The everything bagel was superb. It had a cream cheese frosting with your typical everything bagel toppings; black peppercorns, sesame seeds. The salty and sweet combo had me dreaming about it afterwards.

The London fog donut was good as well! It looks like your typical glazed donut but with one bite, the earl grey hits. 

For $3.50 per donut, they seem pricey but they are also really big! The dough is soft and perfectly fried every single time. If you're ever in the Ritchie area, do stop by.",2020-02-21 04:38:17

We were going to sit inside and the hostess changed our mind and we went outside. I am SO glad she did. The outside dining area was absolutely beautiful!! Colorful and imaginative.

gMqw47BdVZwsk75lHVNl-Q,1,"This spa is a joke. The customer service is the worst of the worst. 

Complain #1: I scheduled a couple day spa which included the use of the jacuzzi hot tub, a couples massage and lunch. The hot tub was the first service we received. The water was ridiculously hot. I am the type of person that loves a hot shower but the water in the tub was almost boiling hot. The receptionist didn't know how to use the remote control to control the bubbles, the tub had to be basically emptied and then filled up. By the time they fixed everything it was time for the massage. The special surprise that I had planned for my boyfriend was pretty much ruined. 

Complain #2:  I became a member of the spa and selected the the VIP package membership.

 I went to go get a oxygen facial. When I went to check out, I was charged full price (minus 15% with my membership discount) for the oxygen facial. 

I asked the receptionist why I was being charged full price when an oxygen facial falls under the advance skin care which is part of my membership. The facial should have been $79.

The receptionist explained to me that the hydra facial AND the oxygen facial are excluded. 

On the pamphlet that was provided when I signed up for my membership, it only describes that the hydrafacial is excluded NOT the oxygen facial. 

The receptionist explained to me that those are old pamphlets and the new ones haven't arrived yet. 

They provide the wrong information to the clients and then expect them to pay the full price. 

Complain #3: with my VIP membership I get a glass of wine and I can use the sauna. Everyone I have called to make an appointment I request to use the sauna prior to my massage and every time I arrive to the spa the sauna is NOT turned on so I have to wait for the sauna to get hot. I'm NEVER offered a glass of wine, I always have to remind them to give me one and the last time I had an appointment I asked for a glass of wine and the receptionist never brought it to me. The lack of detail is unbelievable. It's called a VIP membership because that's how your clients should be treated. 

Complain #4:  I requested to cancel my membership. I was going here for approximately 6 months and was trying to give it a chance but the customer service is just awful. The blonde lady that is usually the receptionist seems like she's so lost sometimes and hardly know the answer to anything. 

I sent an email to the email address on the website requesting to cancel my membership. I received a response that the cancellation has been received and the last payment would be in August.

What happens at the beginning of September.... I get charged for the membership that is supposed to be cancelled. I'm not mad, I know errors happen. I reply to the email and ask if there was an error because I was charged. 3 days later I still have no response to I call the spa ( this was on a Saturday). The blonde lady that's always lost picks up, I explain the situation, of course she can't help me and tells me that she will have Bianca call me. 

The following Tuesday comes around and I still haven't heard from the spa so I call again. The blonde lady answers the phone and says that Bianca isn't there but she will be in the office the next day and she will have her call me. 

Today is Sunday and I still haven't heard back from the management staff. 

It is unacceptable that a customer needs to wait over a week to receive a response. Either the staff needs to be trained on how to handle these situations or Bianca, the owner, needs to be on top of checking emails and returning phone calls. 

With so many options in tampa I would highly advise you to spend your money at another spa.",2019-09-16 03:09:46

For years I would walk past Il Melograno  and chuckle to myself wondering what kind of restaurant could possibly survive being next to a Weight Watchers!  It just seemed so far-fetched to me!  Add that to the fact that I'm a first generation  Italian and can cook just about any dish you can think of, and dining in an Italian restaurant in a strip mall next to WW just didn't excite me. SO when a friend invited me to lunch  at Il Melograno, I was too curious not to accept!

Well, much to my surprise, the restaurant is quaint and understated in its decor. The owners are the servers and are very personable! And the food!  Oh, the food was just like it was when I was growing up. The salmon entree that I had was perfectly crispy on top with a lemon butter & caper sauce and served with spinach, garlic & EVOO. Bella!

My overall impression of Pod is that yes, the food is good, but when they advertise themselves to be a place for unique dining, they really need to hit the mark. Sadly, Pod falls way short. Their prices are high for the portions and location in University City, but I am slightly willing to overlook that because I truly did enjoy the food. However, the restaurant itself is just dirty and I found that so off-putting simply because of their high prices; they really need to pay better attention.

For starters, my sharing plate was dirty with dried, caked on food. Waiter promptly replaced it, but why set the table with that to begin with? We were seated in a window booth that is decorated with little round colored vents-one glance and you could see the vents were full of dust. We looked up to see the dusty/moldy vents lining the ceiling which didn't make us feel better. Cut to the neighboring chairs that had food dripping down them from previous guests. The tables and chairs are white which I understand is not very forgiving, but this restaurant builds itself upon its aesthetic, decor and ambiance and there really isn't an excuse for such eyesores.",2019-04-08 15:33:49

Their dining room is tiny (maybe 4 2-person tables w/ more tables outside than in), so this will make a great take-out or delivery place.  They deliver within their local area with a $10 minimum.

There is soooo much to choose from that I can't wait to try more things.  I'm looking forward to trying their hummus, and my friends have tried and liked the Gouda Burger, Juicy Lucy cheese-stuffed burger, the Gracey filafil, and the Club Veg (pita) as well.

wuxZSSVXwKzN3NPcdSljUA,3,"So let me begin by stating that the owner of Naan Stop is a complete asshole who shorts you on change constantly. This has happened on more than two occasions and is honestly unacceptable, especially for us college students.  

I came here (not for the first time) and thank god that the owner wasn't there. I was served by this woman who gave me a two chicken entrée of the only indian chicken you can have in Isla Vista. I will tell you right now that it was delicious. The naan and the vegetable rice with the two types of curry chicken were great. The only thing that I get upset about is the fact that they seem to be VERY stingy on giving a decent amount of food. CMON NOW! I'm paying $8-$9 dollars for a whole meal... I WANT A FULL MEAL. The tiny salad that they ask whether or not you want is decent but small just as well. 

Naan Stop is a great place to try Indian food or to open your palette to a new type of food. If you are courageous and want to try something different, give it a try as it is actually decent. A little pricey but worth it considering there is nothing near by that compares.

P.S. Do not play Snappa or any type of drinking game before or after eating Naan Stop. Not a good call. I just played two games and my stomach feels like shit. But it's still good food! Also, I am drunk. So take this review with a grain of salt. GOOD DAY!",2011-05-31 03:03:56

XT8U_rCZ4c15BoFkDjkOIA,1,"As soon as we approached the hostess station on Saturday night, I should have known that we were in for a terrible experience. We checked in to the waitlist via Yelp on our way over. The waitlist said under 5 minutes and we were not more than 5 minutes away. We got to the hostess stand outside and were put on another waitlist, not in front but in back of other people who had arrived. I asked about our position in the online waitlist and the hostess said that she didn't check that list and didn't seem interested in honoring our position in line.

I have only ever eaten outside here so I had no idea that there was a seperate host station inside for indoor seating. The hostess outside didn't even bother asking us if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating.

The hostess asked several times how many people in our party even though we were all standing right there. I only had my daughter with me (one child) and she asked how many children menus we needed. As we were seated at our table she ran away as I was asking her for a highchair, ignoring any other requests we may have had. I had to wait for our server to come to the table to request a highchair.

Our server was very nice. He let us take our time with our meal and enjoy each other's company.

At the end of the meal, my parents were taking us out to dinner so they were going to pay. I offered to buy walking drinks for the Ghost Walk so I went to the bar to order. The bar was super packed so I saw our server and asked him to start a new bill and order the drinks. He did and I paid right away since we were at the computer already. Turns out, he charged me for the entire $234.54 bill! Not that I don't want to treat my parents out to a dinner but that was an extremely expensive mistake that he made.

The food was wonderful! The decor was a cool Tahoe vibe!  My daughter was obsessed with watching the guys making the pizzas, they were flipping and spinning each pizza, it was awesome! You don't see that anymore! We ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, and a half cheese half pepperoni pizza. The mozzarella sticks were fresh and flavorful!  The pizza marinara sauce with the mozzarella sticks was wonderful!  The pizza was fantastic! The crust was thin under the sauce and cheese, but think around the edge! A perfect combo!  The pepperoni was a little spicer (not a bad thing) then ""typical"" which was wonderful to balance out the sweetness of the sweet sauce!  There were quite a few customers in the restaurant, but the staff was still very attentive and fast.

40ynIvGD_RYpB8pkqOICOQ,1,"LOL. This place is really a joke. I don't recommend them to anyone. I mean, overall the staff is nice & friendly but that's about all they have going for them. They can't schedule people at the correct locations and when you finally get someone to do it; they let you leave and THEN tell you that you have to come back because the windshield they got for your vehicle is already cracked and they can't do it. You're telling me that they didn't think to check it WAY before??? Not acceptable. Not to mention the crap show of a parking lot, if you can even call it that. It shouldn't take me 10+ mins to get out of their lot. Seems nobody knows what they're doing. Yikes. Should have known by the already bad reviews not to even try it but I wanted to give them a chance. -- UPDATE: okay... ""life happens"" yep, I get that. But maybe, idk, they could check glass BEFORE wasting people's time & money. This response tells me EXACTLY what I need to know. Again-- 0/10. I have never seen such a pitiful company in my life. Now I fully believe every single bad review.",2020-04-23 23:12:30

This place is small but the atmosphere & people are so inviting that you just want to stay and hang out.  I ordered my tacos to go today but while waiting there was a steady stream of people coming in for to go orders or sitting down to enjoy a meal. I order the street tacos= 2 Suadero Tacos and 1 Chicken.  These are small tacos but mighty which are packed with rich flavors that filled me right up!  From the handmade tortillas to the flavorful fillings it was the best comfort food for me.   

If you read my posts you know that I love hole in the wall places and love to buy/eat local.  This place has now been added to the rotation as a must have!.  I will be coming back again and can't wait to try more traditional favorites!",2020-09-20 18:15:24
Ay1lQmdy-kFLJuuV7gx1Iw,5,"This slightly out of the way spot is amazing!! We had seen signs and put it on our must visit list but hadn't yet made it over until tonight. I am so glad we ended up having dinner there!

We were with a group of friends and the restaurant staff went out of their way to clean things and move a few tables so we could be socially distanced and still together. When we arrived there was no one else in the restaurant which made it perfect for conversation. The space isn't super big but spacious feeling. It was exceptionally clean and staff was very attentive and helpful. 

We all ordered off of the large varied menu which features more casual dishes from ramen to curry to pad Thai. We had several people in the group who are rather picky eaters but could find quite a few options.

My husband and I tried vegan pad Thai, A side of vegan fried vegetables, and a vegetarian Ramen. I could not stop eating the pad Thai, and the fried vegetables which were more crispy and healthy tasting than anticipated! My ramen was full of veggies and cake with a side of fresh basil, lime and other items. The food wasn't too salty or fried tasting but rather had a light and seasoned flavor such that you wanted more and more! Everyone ate their items with gusto and kept exclaiming over the exception taste.

This spot is a must try and we will be returning soon!",2020-06-28 01:57:39
OKpcC-NomqaeVkx78dbZxA,5,"Sweet mother of cheesesteaks, these sandwiches are good! Having lived in the Philly outskirts for most of our lives, my husband and I have had our fair share of both authentic and knockoff Philly cheesesteaks. 

I'll be honest- I'm not a fan of the big names like Geno's or Pat's. I don't want chunks of meat, as I prefer a finely chopped quality steak. In that regard, Oven Bros delivers. The meat is perfectly balanced fat/lean with no gristle to be found. The rolls are also the perfect texture- very lightly ""toasty"" on the outside with a soft chew in the middle. 

We had a cheesesteak with American and one with Whiz and- while both were great- I really loved the steak with Whiz. I highly recommend giving Oven Brothers a try, if you haven't already. The steaks are delicious!",2019-12-26 04:23:28
rX25Ai-2nC18LOBStyPs_w,1,"So like many others on here, I'm a fan of Kristin Cavallari and her tv show.  She does a fabulous job of marketing and advertising her jewelry on tv as it's literally all she wears. I also think the minimalist style is very trendy and likable by most, so she's really doing a great job of making people want to buy it. K. Now that that's said, if you're like me, once you decided to go online and actually purchase some pieces, the prices probably shocked you, right? I could NOT believe the prices that the jewelry retails for.  It's cute stuff but NOT that great. You have to take into consideration how simple the designs are. And none of it has any special stones or anything so WHY on earth such the steep prices? I own a lot of Kendra Scott and they are known for their unique stones so I get it why their prices are what they are. More on that comparison in a little bit.  So, I decided I would never purchase any UJ jewelry until it was majorly discounted during a sale. So, during a recent spring sale, some pieces were almost 50% off.  After reading reviews about rings & necklaces tarnishing, I thought well I'll try some earrings as it seemed no one was complaining of those tarnishing. So I ordered 3 pairs of earrings, spent about $115 (this is with the sale prices marked down 30-50%).  When my pieces arrived I could NOT believe the quality. It looked and felt SO cheap. Not even worth the sale prices I paid.  Like another reviewer on here said, I have jewelry from forever 21 and target that FEELS more durable, sturdy and luxurious than this cheap crap. Sorry but that's exactly what it is. CRAP. For these prices? Is this a joke? And from such a wealthy and well known celebrity such as Kristin Cavallari? She says on the show it's her life dream? Is it really? If it is, then invest a little more of your own $ into making it a high quality jewelry line because I'd sure love to know what it's costing them to make such cheap jewelry. At those retail prices, they're making a KILLING in profit. I can make this jewelry myself for a few bucks. Seriously. So, I sent customer service a very honest email stating I would be returning the pieces and that I was so disappointed & shocked with the jewelry and that they should cover the cost of shipping since this wasn't my fault or in my plans to even send back. I expected quality jewelry at even the sale prices I paid and I certainly didn't get that.  They apologized, offered to send me replacements. They emailed me a shipping label. I sent the pieces back. I stated I did NOT want replacements due to the cheap quality. A few days later I get an email with a refund but they charged me for shipping. Not okay. So I called the actual store and ended up actually speaking to Kolby (the one who appears on the show).  She was very nice, good customer service. At first gave me reasons as to why they charged me for shipping and that they could not refund me for the shipping. I told her in that case, I can't wait to write my review and I should have trusted all the other reviews from unhappy customers.  She placed me on hold, comes back and says ""for the sake of your review, I'll refund you for the shipping.""  I said thank you.  She then asked me to tell her in detail what I was unhappy with about the jewelry. So I was VERY honest.  I compared the line to Kendra Scott, which is a high $ luxury line but you get quality, luxury jewelry that will last you forever. It does not tarnish, nor do they have to put a card in the packaging telling you not to wear lotion, perfume or anything, oh and that the pH of your skin can tarnish the jewelry. Why doesn't KS have to do this? Because Kendra Scott is clearly investing in her company and wants to ensure quality products for the customers' money! Everything you are reading here, I said to Kolby.  And I truly give her credit for listening to me and taking it all in in the way that she did.  Like I said, I'm very honest and blunt and I'm sure it was not easy for her to accept my criticism but she did and did it well.  She expressed to me that the company WILL be working with a new manufacturer in the future to fix the issue of the jewelry feeling so cheap.  I told her that's great news but I truly don't think I would believe it until Kristin Cavallari herself come out and address these issues publicly.  Customers deserve to hear the truth.  UJ needs to take ownership and publicly address the issues that we are all experiencing. They need to PUBLICLY tell their customers that they are aware of the issues and that they will be using a new manufacturer to come out with better material, and better quality pieces. I posted about this on my Instagram & had several friends thank me for informing them & a few friends agreed, sent me photos of their broken & tarnished UJ jewelry. UJ, y'all need to do better & do right by your fans & customers. Very disappointing.",2019-07-12 22:13:49

WTkqnK45ILyP-X5bmeB52w,1,I had such a horrible experience at Riverside hotel in New Orleans. I have a disabled son who was denied access to his room along with his service dog during the thanksgiving holidays.  He had cell phone and no money.  He had nothing on but pajamas because they woke him saying that his dog was barking.  The dog was probably barking at them.  My son was missing in a bad area of town due to the managers disrespect for human life. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy go to this hotel Due to the bad choices in management. There laws against removing disabled people. Especially when it's an Ike crime infested area Which was confirmed by the people that work there. This hotel does not deserve even a one star.

We were warmly greeted at the door by the hostess. It was noticeable right away that the staff was following COVID precautions, guests were appropriately spaced, and everyone I saw entering, walking about, and exiting the restaurant were wearing masks. Jake was our waiter and he did a fantastic job explaining the restaurant concept, the menu, and made good suggestions. It's clear he's a star employee and represents the restaurant well. Now for the food.... I started with a watermelon cocktail that had freshly juiced melon in it that was refreshingly delicious. We opted for small plates and dessert instead of an entree. We shared the drunken eggs, ZLT-zucchini topped with brisket , cheese, panko crumbs and a delicious tomato reduction, crispy chicken biscuit sandwiches, and pork belly with melon. Everything was delicious, but the stand out was the ZLT. Dessert was an espresso chocolate torte that was rich yet light and a coconut key lime pie that tasted of fresh key limes. We were happily stuffed when we left and will definitely return and highly recommend.",2020-08-10 12:30:28

Rh1Su109GN7efi3MlshFPQ,4,"I really loved the food and service. I mean, the food was near perfect. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because some of it was too salty, and that was really disappointing. The mac-n-cheese was everything I could have asked for, but just like the spaghetti and fish, the salt made it difficult to eat. Perhaps if they cut back on the salt, the food will taste as perfect as it looks! Everything else was top notch. I got a mad case of nostalgia with the hot water cornbread that reminded me of my late grandmother's recipe. The sweet potatoes, chicken wings and everything else was great. 

The service was thorough. We came in with a huge group, over 40, for our family reunion, and the staff accommodated us very well. I will definitely come back whenever I'm in St. Louis again!",2014-08-16 02:47:47
oFuZcJakXnNJinl5B6q77g,4,"I think this show was very entertaining. I've seen some other Cirque shows (The Beatles Love and another one in Vegas) and the Beatles one is still my all time favorite. I've seen that one twice it's so good!  In saying that, this one was different but still enjoyable. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone that might be going to see it so I'll try and be vague in my descriptions. There are acts like juggling, jump roping, extreme bike riding, aerial stuff, and more (I don't want to give it away). All the performers are very talented. My absolute favorite portion was the part with trampoline artists. It was crazy to see how coordinated they are together. 

The venue is so cool, you feel like you are actually in a building and not in just a glorified tent. It's air conditioned and actually cold in there! Drinks will put you back a pretty penny...those of the alcoholic kind. I got a sangria and that was $15.  A can of bud light is the same price. I'm not sure how much the other concessions were as I did not partake. 

The show started promptly at 8 and ran almost until 10pm with like a 20-25 minute intermission. Another favorite part of mine was that there was a dude that looked like Pauly D from the Jersey Shore in it. I didn't care for his strange comedic act...but I just was obsessed with the fact he was a spitting image of Pauly D. 

The music was wonderful as well. It was performed by a live band which is always great. 

If you are considering going and have some extra cash to burn it's definitely an entertaining show. Do I think it's the best Cirque show I've ever seen? No. But this isn't Vegas people so calm down.

The cone itself is easy to grip and delicious to the last, cheesy bite. One thing I love about it is the consistency of the crust, it's crispy from the beginning to the end. The mix of toppings is great as every bite is cheesy and has a good collection of tasty treats in it. I like the fact that you can choose your own toppings if you don't want a pre-set option.

Got a bid from them on an electric project and wanted to get other bids. To my surprise, I got  a call from apparently the owner of the company, yelling and cursing about how I wasted their time by not hiring them to do the job right away.  They quoted me over two thousand for the job and I simply wanted a second opinion.   

Funny part is, I paid for the estimate and their time to come out.  $45 for them to come out and look at the house for 10 min. And normal people get second opinions!  I've never even heard of a contractor calling and yelling at the client because the client didn't book right away!

I've personally never experienced such ridiculousness and rudeness until now. I actually had to laugh out of shock after that conversation.  After the rude call, I googled them and saw multiple reviews where others have said the same thing: a man, apparently the owner called them yelling and cursing.  So I guess it's not just me.

hqr0F0tU7CFCISxfEpuk1Q,4,"This place. THIS PLACE! Is pretty darn awesome, yet eerie and just all around odd BUT I love it. I have been blessed with a father in law who loves German food so we go here nearly every time they're in town. First of all it is in a bit of a run down area and seems a bit sketchy but once you get inside you realize how truly unique this place is. The decor is definitely a German blast from the past but I don`t mind that. I`m a huge fan of different and out of the norm so this worked for me. The service is always SLOW. That I will say about this place. I`m not coming here for a quick lunch, though, so that never really bothered me too much. It is definitely a sit down, take your time, enjoy your company, and chew your food slowly sort of place. Seriously. Chew slowly because it could be a while before you can flag down a waitress for the check to exit. That aside the food here is delicious. I don`t have much experience with German food but I think I could successfully visit Germany and not starve based on this restaurant's selections. I`ve sampled the sausage and herring appetizer plates along with my table and I`m a fan of both. The herring tastes like tuna in a tangy cream sauce. The sausage plate is just yummy! I mean, who doesn't like a good German sausage? That person is not me. Moving on. I`ve had two different dishes here before. One was a vegetarian dish that included cabbage, spaetzle, and some other non animal products. That was my first visit and I don`t really recall anything special about it. The flavors were good but I never ordered it again. What I do order each time now is the sauerbraten plate with potato pancakes. Good god! Talk about a heart attack on a plate with those potato pancakes but who cares about the health aspect. The sauerbraten is AMAZING! So tender, so flavorful, and the sauce it comes with is perfect. The potato pancakes are so greasy and sinful. Addicting is another word. Makes me want to eat a plate of them and then workout. They serve some bread rolls at the beginning of the meal that are usually crusty and not worth eating but if you're really hungry and are waiting(a very long time) for your meal you might want to just risk chipping a tooth. Slap some butter on that roll, and chow down. They have a small wine selection. I usually get some Riesling or Piesporter. No complaints there. Have a few glasses and the whole slow service issue wont even matter. Trust me. Check this place out if only to say that you've gone, tried the food, and escaped at some point.",2012-04-07 14:24:19

The coleslaw was also very good and so were the biscuits, also a little sweet with maybe some honey for flavor. The Mac and cheese was very cheese with some rich and strong flavors of cheeses... some may not like how overpower the cheese can be, others may find this very pleasing. It was a great creaminess. 

This was a take out order, so we can't really comment on facility not staff... though picking up was easy and employees seemed very happy and friendly. 

Cost was $40 and I feel we got a good amount of food for the cost... but it won't feed 4 adults. We had 2 adults and 2 very young children and we added our own green beans and ran out of food. So I'd suggest this for a dinner for 2, and you may have a little bit then left over.

onQsolCnpHwtOZCIuI91vQ,4,"Finally made it back with a couple friends on Sunday, one of which is Filipino. We asked him to take the lead as far as ordering so we could get an across the board (ish) take of the cuisine. This is what he ordered for the table of 4 and a toddler. I didn't get any pictures because too busy devouring food.

a) Bijon guisado - this is the thinner rice noodle pancit. This is the style I am used to and it was perfect in every way! Loaded with tasty noodles and veggies like cabbage, snow peas and carrots along with pork (again last time I did the chicken one with the spaghetti style noodles). 100% getting this again.

b) Bistek tagalog - I think this might have been my favorite thing of the day. And it is so simple, beef and onions in a sauce.  The citrus marinade makes the meat tender AF! My husband couldn't get enough of this dish. The accompanying sauce with it is packed with notes of sour and sweet, but still savory. Perfect over rice. 

c) Sinigang na baboy - or pork hot and sour soup basically.  It is closer to a Thai style than Chinese, but definitely and obviously its own thing. Very light colored broth filled with big hunks of pork (with bone), okra, green beans, eggplant (I think). Honestly, my first time having okra and I am a convert, in this instance, no slime (I've heard it can be slimy), the outside retains some texture like a green bean and then the seed pods are almost like mini peas. Overall, a very light, and bright soup.  

d) Fried pompano - ordered this once again, still a mild fish with zero greasiness. It is good on its own, but is kicked up just a notch with that touch of soy sauce. 

My main take away was that the food is jam packed with flavor, but not heavy or overwhelmingly greasy. Every new bite was fun and a surprise and I am really glad to broaden my palate a bit with this. As I stated in my last review, my go to ""cuisine"" is asian flavors, and this is a new favorite. 

So run, don't walk and support this hole in the wall establishment. It doesn't come across as very busy, and the prices are incredible (too low honestly). I hope it is a lasting institution for the area. If you're in need of something new, and a food that isn't oversaturated in Reno or overly represented, I suggest spending a lunch coming here and exploring the offerings. 

Overall, I am sold on this style of cuisine. Every single thing was unique in flavor while still understanding the common thread of what makes it fillipino food.  Obviously I am no expert but just fell in love with the food today. I was surprised at how much food there was too. We had 4 adults and a toddler and thought 4 dishes were barely going to cover it but we had a ton of leftovers. 

As far as atmosphere, yes the booths are a bit run down aka second hand, but the rest is very clean. The only semi negative thing was once we got our food, we had to flag down the server for boxes and a check.  And there were a couple flies that were relentless and annoying.

We had Tony the sales rep come over and he agreed it was their fault and they would take care of the cost of repair. I contacted Tony many times with no reply to furnish the repair invoice.

4N_fo6bBgHBPjLGUOV2EhA,2,"Me and my husband took the kids (5 & 7 yo's) to this last night.  The pre-boarding area was more fun than the actual train ride itself.  It was very festive with lights and Xmas decorations with activities for the kids to do beforehand.  Many picture opportunities.  I am glad we went on a week night because it was cheaper and less crowded than a weekend. 

Once we boarded, we were seated in our the first class area that we chose.  These tickets were $59 per seat and had to be bought in groups of 4.  My group got to face one another with a small table and we each got hot chocolate and a cookie.  The kids were excited about this.  The cookie was not very good and hot chocolate was cold. 

The ride took about 30-40 minutes.  During the ride the crew danced and sang which was fun and festive.  They tried reading part of the Polar express book but no one in my group could hear it.  The train goes through downtown and through the landing.  My 7 yo step son was more interested in the homeless people on the riverfront than the train ride.  

Towards the end of ride Santa gets on the train and hands out bells.  One of the crew punched the kids golden tickets which they enjoyed.  The kids had a decent time but I don't think we would do it again.  Probably not worth $239 for 4 tickets and then the $5 parking.

The store is clean & well stocked. But the reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because they made some changes to he store that IMO aren't for the better. First off, ever since they got rid of the self-checkout machines, it seems like the lines are longer & there's more of a wait time to check out. They also decided in removing the self-checkout, they'd add a couple more cashier lanes, plus they switched the customer service area to the other side of the store. Now, it's in the way. If you're checking out at customer service, or if you're not using one of the cashier lanes, there's barely any room in between the first lane & the wall of the customer service area. And with people waiting & carts & whatnot, it's just barely any room to get by when you're trying to leave. And having the customer service area on the other side of the store just gets in the way as well. It used to be out of the way of everything, but now where they have it, when people are waiting in line for it it blocks off the front of the store.

But I've experienced one of the worst treatments of beef at any premium steakhouse.

We were two couples who visited there on a Saturday night before a bowl game. My wife and I both ordered the prix fixe Reveillon offering, which included butternut squash and shrimp bisque, a salad, two 4-oz filets, and a dessert of red velvet souflee with egg nog ice cream. Sounds delicious!

As for the other couple, she ordered seared scallops and he wanted meat! So he got the 12 ounce strip, medium, grill fired.

The bisque was amazing. The salad was a salad. My medium rare filets were way off the mark. One was medium and the other medium well. My wife ordered medium, but her's were identical to mine! But we didn't complain. Why not?

Because my buddy's steak came out looking like it had never seen a flame. It was blue. I love a blue steak, but I distinctly hear him say medium. No problem. He sent it back, and the server apologized profusely.

We had finished eating our entrees by the time the steak returned. This time it was rare. Still not what he ordered, but now he was angry. And it's hard to blame him.

At first I suspected that the cooks didn't want to overcook prime beef. But that wasn't the case because they did mine. 

There are too many options in the French Quarter, much less metro New Orleans to endure bad dishes or dishes not cooked to order.

bAGyBF4pYjQKsPSa19TcIw,1,"DO NOT LEASE HERE
I've lived at this location for over a year and I cannot wait to leave. 
Over the past year I have filed more than one noise complaint (3 in person, 15 on the phone)  do to my upstairs neighbors. At one point, they had their music (specifically the base) so loud that my desktop monitor that was mounted on the wall fell off because my whole apartment was vibrating. This is particularly annoying because I lived in the ""quiet building"" that does claimed to have a zero tolerance policy for noise. 
The management is absolutely awful. They have never done anything to help with the noise or any other issue that has come up. 
The latest in the long list of sub-par management has been their handling of an apartment fire that resulted in a flood (from the sprinklers) in half a dozen different apartments (including mine). The water came through the walls and flooded my bedroom, soaking my shoes and clothes. The management staff, instead of immediately getting in touch with me, decided to send in a restoration team that put all of my wet clothes into piles to set there and develop mildew. These crews gave me absolutely no time to grab my stuff or move it myself, and instead, a bunch of strange men touched every single one of my belongings and moved them for me. 
The cadence did not offer to move me to a hotel or anywhere else, nor provide me with a project time frame of how long the repairs would take. The only answer I got were from the contractors that came in to rip up carpet, base boards, dry wall, and insulation. When I asked them what was happening, they responded with ""there's black mold in the walls that is not from the flood."" meaning the poor construction of the building left me exposed to black mold for god only knows how long. 
My issue with this stems from the fact that not only is this bad for my health, but I was informed of it through a THIRD PARTY rather than from the MANAGEMENT STAFF who are supposed to be responsible for handling all of these issues. 
I called them, my insurance agent called them, my lawyer called them, even my mother called them, and they have not returned a single phone call or email. 
Today, I handed them a 5 days notice that I would be terminating my lease due to health related hazards and I will be moving out within the next three days. I have never been more relieved in my life. 

TL;DR the management sucks, the building is not safe, I HIGHLY recommend you do not live here. The amenities are nice, proximity to downtown is nice, but it is not worth the headache.",2018-03-20 23:42:42

Here is what we ordered and this is what we received for approximately $106.00. You are seeing a Key Lime pie that's advertised as enough to share for two people.  Pinto Beans. Potato Salad. Collard greens. They are real tough and chewy. Not how we like them at all. We had to trash those. Corn bread. A half pound of Pork Ribs. Do you see that. You can barely see it. Very small portion for the price. They were tender but not much flavor. 6  naked chicken wings. They were alright. I had the Truffle Mac and Cheese. The Pasta had no flavor at all. You could taste a little bit of the truffle but really could only find flavor in the cheese. Now take a good look at the Holy Trinity that was $35.00. Ribs, sausage, and brisket. Don't waste your money. Look at it! The Brisket was tender but once again, no flavor, same for the ribs as stated before, the sausage, idk it tasted like it had gone bad . And the customer service was poor. Jason who was answering the phone this day, hung up on me three times as I attempted to place an order. I was persistent and would call right back. Finally on the fourth try he said hello. I asked why he continued to disconnect the line and he blamed it on not knowing how to use the phone system. Now MANAGEMENT, I ask you, how many customers have you lost because of this? If he was busy he could have answered and possibly said, ""please hold"", anything instead of hanging up on a paying customer. I should have gone elsewhere after the first disconnect. I truly wish that I had. There are too many good restaurants in King of Prussia with better food, better prices, good portions and great customer service. I will not be going back. They were recently advertised on TV and given a good review. Maybe that was for TV because look at the food. Does it look appealing to you? Look at the undercooked greens, the very small portion of ribs, etc. No way is that a half pound, on the worst scale. Unbelievable!!! Save your money and your time. It's not worth it. I wasted my hard earned money. Don't waste yours. Prior to going here I told so many people to try this place. I'm sorry if I don't catch you in time to tell you of my experience. Look, you can get better barbecue at Dwights and Deke's. Tender, juicy, great portions, flavorful, great customer service, and cost effective. Save your money and time don't go and be as disappointed as me and my family.  They don't deserve any stars. Everything that looks good to you is not good for you. Don't let the outside building structure and the hoopla fool you. My food was not good. Jason tried to push me to order online. Why??? When we arrived at the restaurant it was empty so why wasn't I given royal treatment? He continually hung up the phone then tried to press me to order online. What are they paying you for Jason? To stand there hang up on people, try to push them to order online, etc. No Jason what you are doing is causing this business to lose money. I didn't like the barbecue sauce either.... They should close this place down. It's a joke, just like Jason. Don't order Takeout or Delivery, you've been warned!!!   I now have indigestion. Let me find some Tums.  Did you see the size of the side orders? One Ounce cups at best for $12.00. This place is a rip off. Buyer Beware!!! This is not even a one star restaurant. Don't let the location fool you. I wish I had read the reviews prior to giving this place a try. I would have NEVER EVER had given them a try.

I've taken my vehicle to this location several times with each time being a terrible experience. I needed an alignment and was replacing suspension parts. It took them three tries to get it right. Each time I had to take it back included several days for them to work on it as well as the costs for me to Uber back and forth 2 additional times.

I took it back later for another alignment months later, and I also needed the travel mode turned off as my car automatically puts itself in that mode when it's not driven. I do this every spring as I don't drive the two seater in the winter months. It took them an additional day over what I was told to do the alignment, and when I went to pick it up, they didn't even try to turn off the travel mode (you need a car computer). I asked the mechanic if he could do it really fast, since I waited and paid for this service, and he told me he didn't know how and sent me on my way. When I tried to complain to corporate, they did nothing. No refund for the service I didn't even receive. 

This last time I called at 8am yesterday and asked if I could bring my car in for a routine state inspection. I said if it's going to take a few days, I can't go with pep boys I need to take it somewhere else. I was told my car would be serviced today, if not first thing tomorrow morning. So I bring it in by 9am. By noon the next day I call the shop to see how things are going, and the person on the phone tells me they haven't even begun to work on the car yet. I said I asked you guys in advance that if it was going to take more time, I would just simply go elsewhere. I was in a time crunch. The person puts me on hold, and then comes back and says you can come get your keys and take the car, essentially wasting 2 days of my time, and now I have to rent a car last minute because they still are not done with my car at 4pm. It's a damn inspection! It's one of the simplest procedure a mechanic has to do!

I will be taking my business to a small business/mechanic who actually works on cars and doesn't treat customers like garbage. DO NOT EVER USE THIS PLACE!",2021-12-31 20:40:42
9HpMD7QFhZyQJ6FuotwNWQ,5,"Their Grove location was the bomb. Delicious food. Reasonably priced. The pork steak was thick tender (they don't even give you a knife and you don't need it) and huge. My husband and I split the left overs the next day. Great rub. Yummy on-the-table bbq sauces. Fries were plentiful and delicious and I don't even like fries, but I couldn't stop eating these, especially with the special dipping sauce. The Brussels sprouts were the best I have ever had and I order and cook them a lot. I didn't like the beans--too plain, but everything else was good: pulled pork, brisket, turkey. Staff was friendly, service efficient, enjoyable atmosphere. Loved the butcher shop where we got a good bottle of nouveau beaujolais to drink with dinner ànd a gorgeous steak to cook at home. Highly recommend. Can't wait to come back.",2021-12-20 11:58:50
zQSW0_fi46U_066lo88GXQ,1,I only come to this location because the parking is convenient. The service is terrible. First of all the women working there have no idea how insurance works or how to properly log it in to the system. On multiple occasions I have had trouble getting blood work done because the people here are so poorly trained they don't have any clue how to get in contact with billing. Second of all what ever happened to service with a smile. I have encountered several different women here all with abysmal attitudes. Finally it is ridiculous that I take time to make an appointment online and I am not seen anywhere close to that time. Every time I have been here there is only one person running the front desk and taking bloods and every time the blood draw is more painful than it should be.,2020-01-15 15:06:30
hiALLsHzVaxmqQXZ1zYsog,4,"Amazing, amazing! I've been here twice so far, and plan on coming back many more times in the future. To start off, this place is definitely not your standard ""American food"" joint; I guess it's supposed to be classified as ""New American"" although that's pretty vague. And I will also note that I took my relatives visiting from Taiwan here and they weren't huge fans, I guess in part because they weren't used to these types of flavors. But if you're looking for American food with a little twist, this is definitely the place for ya!

Of the drinks menu, I've gotten the Antisocial Extrovert which was a little too sour for my liking, but was still good. There's a lot of good cocktail options and most come in super cute little cups.

And of the dinner menu, I've just stuck with the small plates (the large plates are a little bit out of the poor post-grad's budget). Some of the small plates are large enough to fill you up, but some are definitely just appetizer small plates so I'd ask if you're trying to just order a small plate as an entree. I've tried the pork & pear flatbread, the mac and cheese, pork belly confit, rosemary truffle fries, and the bread pudding. The pork & pear flatbread is amazing and filling (have ordered twice), but that combination of savory meat, pesto, and fruit might not appeal to everyone. The mac and cheese is really good as well, and the bread crumbs on top add a nice little crunch (make sure you get the loaded mac and cheese, because on it's own I think it gets a little boring). The pork belly is good, fatty in the right spots, but this is one example of a plate that definitely won't fill you up. The fries are great and come with two dipping sauces and seasoned with, you guessed it, rosemary. Lastly, I have dreams about that bread pudding sometimes. It's just great. Try it out.",2017-09-14 03:14:06
2n1VIiuJueBRHDytgTq9Zg,5,We had heard of this place from my daughter who had been here before so we decided to make it our last meal in Tucson before heading back to Phoenix. So glad we did! We were originally going to go for breakfast because Hubby was craving Huevos Rancheros but we ended up getting there more towards lunchtime but it didn't matter because the entire menu is available all day. How cool is that?! We sat inside but I could see a really nice patio that was full of patrons enjoying their meals. We were served chips and salsa upon being seated and we both opted for one of their signature margaritas. I went for the Mango Chili margarita and Hubby had the Blood Orange. Both were good but I preferred Hubby's just a bit more. Hubby stayed true to his craving and went with the Huevos Rancheros and said they were very good. I on the other hand decided to give the lunch side of the menu some attention and went for the Best of New Mexico Combination plate so I could taste a little of everything. The Green Chili Chicken Enchilada rocked it as did the Chili Relleno. Both were delicious! Even though we were both stuffed and had a couple of to go containers to take with us that we weren't able to finish I still wanted my Fried Ice Cream. Come on! You can't have Mexican food without Fried Ice Cream! Well that's my motto anyways! Theirs was the basic cornflake kind which happens to be my favorite and I always keep it simple with honey only. All in all a great meal and a place I would recommend as well as return to!,2021-02-21 22:03:04

We go and my little person always has lots of questions and we over order. I look in the rear view mirror while he does this, so don't judge me if we take a little time. LIke I said, looking in the review mirror, I note if someone is coming. Luckly we have been blessed not to hold someone up. OK love love love love their coffee. Not bitter, not weak, perfect and price is right. Their soups seem a little salty, but not locally their fault, bc they are prepackaged. The bread is perfect everytime and the sandwiches are wonderful. We get the beef and asiago cheese often and love it. Not a fan of onions so we ask to 86 them. Also get the turkey sandwich and the bagels. Great deal 13 bagels and 2 smears for a great price. Again SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE. THEY ARE AMAZING. Tip! They are so amazing!",2015-10-24 18:46:58

You normally order at the counter. It was early when we went so she just waited on us at the table. Very friendly people. I got the sausage plate which was a lot of food. I wasn't huge fan of the sausage, but it was good. The spices just felt off to me, but that's just my personal opinion.  The mac and cheese I really liked....it was creamy and reminiscent of velveeta, also a favorite of mine.  I know, classy right?  Who cares...its awesome.  

My wife had the pulled pork sandwich.  I had some of it and I thought it was really good. I didn't even think it needed sauce. I had been burned out on pulled pork but I'd go back and order this.  The potato salad she had was also good. 

Definitely worth going back.",2019-10-04 21:57:19

EVERY child had an exceptionally great experience and loved the various activities.  When they run over to tell you ""This is so much fun!"", you know you made the right choice!!  They were split into 2 groups.  There are two sides to the building, each with a different set up, and the kids were able to enjoy each by switching midway.  Mickey and his team were incredibly attentive and made sure they had a good time while remaining safe and shared the spaces.  This is a great place for kids to engage in fitness activities, have fun, and as a parent you can let them enjoy that and know that their safety is important for everyone to have a great time!!",2017-05-14 12:35:53
fkHmRCsHSGkHJQ4ai5BtLg,2,"Decided to ignore the previous not so good yelp reviews and live dangerously for a change but sadly this joint lives up to all the mediocre reviews that are posted...

I should have known the minute I stepped through the doors and was greeted by the sourpuss hostess who was abrupt and seemed bothered by our request for a warmer table away from the  door.  In fact she refused to seat us away from the door, stating it would be a hardship for the waitress.  Half the tables were empty.

We ordered the mixed green salad and a veggie pizza to share.  The salad was standard but fresh and plentiful.  The pizza was very bland and lacking in the sauce department.  Tasted fresh just nothing to write home about.  I will concede that aside from the hostess without the mostest the service was good- 

I cannot recommend this place because I was expecting a pizzeria and really this is just a bar that is fronting as a pizza place...",2019-02-17 23:52:58
ZVn0zD_GxUHNQjfVLZAMtQ,5,"Came on busy 4th of July late afternoon, eventually greeted by an exhausted server who was seen running back and forth, yet constantly updating us on every detail - what was taking so long, when he would be with us, what he was doing while he was gone, excellent communication with his customers. Also love the rustic look that is kept constant even in the trailer bathrooms.

Drinks: Had some limited edition Liberty Bell IPA, was pretty solid. Sold on the fact that it was limited edition. Good selection of craft beers, wish there were beers with higher ABV content though.

Food: came hungover already so I wanted to eat everything. had the bacon cheeseburger, and split the fried pickles and Mac and cheese. Also tried a bite of the spicy shrimp roll. The best thing I tried was the fried pickles, the best I've had! Complemented everything else nicely. The portion sizes are also well worth the price, $5 for Mac and cheese that's a ""side portion"" it absolutely was not a side portion, which makes it great to share. I couldn't finish my burger either because it was huge.

Activities: they have ping pong tables, that hacky sack game (name?) and giant Jenga. They also have games featured on their drop down screens. 

Overall: such a great time, would love to come back here.",2015-07-06 05:00:08

Healthy tasty options.
The Yumm Bento with teriyaki chicken was tasty and the Yumm sauce added a nice unique kick. 
The Chilean Zucchini Bowl was a home run, its what you get when you combine a rice bowl with a Zucchini soup,  we loved it!
The Original Bowl was a decent bowl until we added the Yumm sauce it then became a really tasty treat. 
This was our first time eating at Cafe Yumm but apparently the Yumm Sauce has a cult following and I can see why,  it's good!",2019-01-30 18:34:53
9_U0tFZSKGudgphG_Y4Wmg,4,"In general when I eat out, I tend to go for sandwiches.  So, this was definitely a change of pace for me. I tried the Yumm! Baby Bowl. The only customization that I made to the order was to skip the black olives. 

The Thai jasmine rice was cooked perfectly. The Yumm! sauce was extremely tasty. I wish that there had been more sauce on the rice. I didn't request additional, but that might have been possible. They do have soy sauce and other condiments available near the water station.  I also tried a teriyaki tempeh skewer. Loved it! It had a nice texture and the teriyaki glaze was delicious. 

I try to eat light,  so I appreciated the lower calorie option of the small bowl.  It was priced a bit high IMO.  As others have noted,  the menu items are fairly expensive for the portion size.  

It's not fast food. However, the service is fast. They even have a drive through. If I worked in the area, I'd definitely consider dropping in here during my lunch hour.",2019-11-19 00:07:01
5nd9UFG5AY_PEsUYZoCKJg,3,"I wish I could give Riddle Ale House a solid 3.5, because that's what this visit was. I popped in here on a Monday afternoon for a quick lunch before my dentist's appointment. Our hostess and waitress were absolutely nice and super friendly. Got the Riddle Ale sampler (as a meal) and the Hot Roast Beef sandwich.
Then we waited...for over 35 minutes for our food. Luckily the day was nice and sunny as we sat in the sun room. The waitress came over and apologized, she said one of the cooks had an accident and had to be rushed to the emergency room. The roast beef sandwich was good and the sampler was excellent. Their cheese steak rolls taste homemade and their wing sauce is very good. The onion rings were room temperature and not crispy, but since we were in a rush, I didn't complain (it's onion rings..who gives a shit?).
In the future if something happens, the waitress (or someone) should come to the tables and say something along the line of ""Your food is late, we're short staffed"".

Overall, a good spot. I'll be back.",2016-03-01 04:57:47

2ZwkoCXl4VuMz2qOCFXNpw,4,"Dous at City Market just opened on September 5th. I've heard great things about their kitchen and food truck and wanted to try for myself.

 I ordered the balance Bowl for $6. It was a great choice for the cooler day as it was served warm with spinach leaves, rice, black beans, red pepper and a tasty chipotle aioli. The menu stated it was served with an egg and silly me thought that actually meant a whole egg . It was just a teaspoon of finally chopped up egg. I would definitely add chicken or Tofu for the $2 up charge or even avocado for $1, for the next time.

 I will definitely be back to try their other items. I hear the Leblebi (a chickpea soup) is great. Vegan and vegetarian friendly with several options.

Be sure to check out their blog.",2017-09-08 17:15:46

Extensive food and drink menu. There were even some non-seafood items for those in your party who can't eat shell fish.

Side salad was robust. Fresh salad mix of spinach, and mixed baby greens with ripe tomato and chunks of cucumber. The bacon vinaigrette is light and tasty. 

Fish Camp Shrimp was very tasty. A definite repeat when we come back next time. Nice size portion for one or to share with three people. The polenta cake was light and creamy. The shrimp and tomato with capers was seasoned very well. 

The fried clam strips were very good as well. Lightly beer battered and meaty. Good size pieces, not your typical over fried greasy clams in a basket. For $2 more get the fries and cold slaw (made fresh).

A definite repeat for us. We will be back to try another tasty option!",2019-03-23 02:58:17

I brought my ethnic club and we sat in a little room with a table just the right size for us :). Most of us tried the #18 and all of us loved the hot sausage the most. 

When our food was served I felt like I was right back at my Grandma's house. The plate designs are all from the 60's/70's or even before. That paired with the homemade cooking makes you feel like you're with family.

Only issue is they have gratuity included and it's at managers discretion right on the menu: Theoretically they could charge you a 100% tip, (ours was only 10).

The deviled eggs were delicious and so was the chicken and waffles entree. I NEVER order chicken and waffles because I feel like, though it is a simple meal, it's easily destroyed by many restaurants (dry, over fried chicken, hard waffle, etc). This one was done to perfection. The waffles were fluffy and the chicken was flavorful and fried just enough. The bacon syrup had a nice flavor but wasn't overly sweet.

I ordered ahead, but there were so many people ahead of me that I waited probably as long as I would have had I just ordered in line. Then there was the actual pizza. I didn't realize we were stealing Domino's tactics with the conveyor belt cooking method, but okay, I get it: costs. Takes less time to teach someone how to use a peel and oven than put it on a belt. But surely that means the ingredients were up to par? Sort of.

I got a bunch of stuff on my pizza, and at this point I can't specifically tell you what, but it was a glorified margherita, and it kinda just looked like they sprinkled it haphazardly and barely touched any heat.

When I saw yelp was doing a $10 special I was all about jumping on this deal!  My husband and I  decided to try it out on a Friday night around 5:30. When arriving we were able to walk right to the register to place our order. We both got the tacos el compadre. One order was with cheese the other without. Once our order was placed we received our drinks and were told to come back in about 20 minutes. 


We took our drinks and sat outside on their front patio and waited about 20-25 minutes and decided to go in and see if our order was done. By now there was a line out the door and it was kinda of confusing...like do I wait in line where people are ordering? Is there another line for pick ups? Do they call your order out??   I realized that I had get back in the order line and ask about our order.  They then went into the kitchen area and had to find our order.  I think that they need to use a PA system over their speakers to announce that your order is ready to pick up, it would help with the confusion and congestion in the ordering line, especially since the dining room is closed and people are waiting on the patio like we were.

As for the food, the tacos are legit! We both preferred the tacos without the cheese, the ones without the cheese seemed to have more meat in them and we both liked the sauce that you dunked your tacos in. Both the beans and rice were both delicious!  But I would definitely go back for the tacos!",2020-08-31 00:51:58

The reason I was wrong about this place is that my friend from England was visiting and she chose this place out of the blue. Usually when she does this, it turns out bad. 

Lucky for us, it worked out alright. Sit down for drinks and food, the ladies ordered nice fruity drinks that they enjoyed and us men ordered beer. After that, I was looking for the bathroom and saw my football game on tv. After that, I watched the rest of my game as my hamburger got cold.

Chicken Marsala - 3.5 stars. Have had it at other Italian restaurants and found it to have a little more gravy. Found this to be a little dry and bland. Cooked nicely but could use some flavoring.

pVLtjRxe0M5vHMhqji7ScQ,5,"Found out this place opened just over a month ago! I was immediately intrigued and wanted to try it. I just moved from San Diego, a city that's all about trendy and photo worthy desserts. So my expectations are pretty high.

And this place definitely met my expectations! I loved the interior. It's so spacious and well decorated. They have plenty of stations to make the rolled ice cream creations, though they only needed to use two at the time. And they have plenty of staff members working diligently to get orders done. There's a good selection of rolled ice cream flavors. In addition, you can choose from a vanilla, a chocolate, or a vegan coconut milk base. And I love how every order gets their choice of whatever three toppings they want. 

The price at $6.99 seems pretty reasonable to me. I was definitely satisfied by the end of my frozen treat. The birthday cake flavor with vanilla ice cream was so good. It's rich and tasty. I can't wait to try a different flavor when I come back!",2019-07-22 03:26:17

We probably went overboard with momos (Tibetan dumpling things), but it was SO worth it. We ordered the Momo Combo with beef, chicken, and veggie momos. All of them were delicious, even the veggie one, and the dipping sauce is incredible! We also ordered the Firecracker Momos because they sounded delicious and we love spice. The sauce the Firecracker Momos were in was very flavorful and packed a good amount of heat. Tip - If you're sensitive to spicy foods, I would not order these.

We also ordered Chili Chicken, which came with white rice. That was also incredible. We ate everything in one sitting and we're very satisfied with our experience.

vwiezQUmidC1B3Xhy0e8jA,4,"This particular Courtyard property was my home-away-from-home for a while turning my relocation to this area.  I've always liked this properties in general, and this location in particular worked fairly well for me; the pluses far outweighed the minuses.

On the plus side, the property is relatively new, the rooms are spacious and equipped with either an oversized arm chair (in the rooms with two queens) or a couch (in the rooms with king size beds).  The bathrooms are good-sized and well appointed - there were always lots of towels, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc.  The hotel has a nice patio that overlooks the riverfront, with love seats as well as chairs and tables under umbrellas.  All of the furniture centers around a nice firepit.

The staff throughout my stay was always helpful and pleasant; they gave me several good restaurant suggestions as well.

On the minus side, I have two complaints:

1) Despite rack room rates that aren't all that inexpensive, breakfast isn't included in the price of the room - there's not even complimentary coffee.

2) This is one of the noisiest new hotels I've stayed at in recent memory.  The walls must be paper-thin, as I heard a lot of noise from neighboring rooms and the floor above when the hotel was busy.  There's also a fair amount of street noise at all hours.  I have no idea about the construction details for this property, but clearly noise wasn't a factor that the planners took into consideration.

Fortunately for me, I'm not a light sleeper so despite the noise issues, I found my stay here very enjoyable.  I have no problem recommending this property to anyone who can abide by a bit more noise than average.",2018-05-22 19:18:56

My suggestion is you should probably go to hospital or Emergency if it's immediately important and never neglect the symptom till another day if it's unbearable. Then book an appointment to see the eye specialists here. Although this store is new the atmosphere feels fresh and high quality. I may need to set up an appointment here for eye check ups and purchasing glasses. Staff is friendly and have this professionalism feeling when you talk with them.

CHuttPq3PpoKgdYnxAYKHQ,2,"I feel like I'm going to get some hate for this review but I have to be completely honest. I came to El Guero Canelo with super high expectations. This is supposed to be the place for the best, world-famous Sonoran dogs, according to multiple websites. Maybe I should have listened to the locals I met the night before...

This particular location was having system issues on the day I visited so there was a longer than usual wait. I don't mind waiting, especially when I'm getting the best of the best. But what I got was so far south of what I imagined. First off, there was very little jalapeño sauce and mayo, and what there was under the pile of tomatoes, not generously over the top as advertised. My bun was also very soggy, I ended up tearing away a good portion of it. The hot dog was okay. Not bad, but nothing outstanding either. This was my very first Sonoran dog, and unfortunately I was very disappointed in this southern Arizona staple. 

I also ordered a serving of arroz con lèche which to my dismay was just a cup of pre-packaged store-bought crap. No where was it advertised that this is the case so I expected housemade rice pudding.

El Guero Canelo almost claims to have the best carne asada, so I'm going to give the one more try next time I'm in Tucson. I hope to update my review with three more well-deserved stars.",2021-11-15 22:40:03

After glancing at the top rated A/C repair companies on Yelp, my husband found Hot 2 Cold. Hot 2 Cold had several appointments scheduled that morning, but they said they could be at our house around noon. As promised, Hot 2 Cold arrived around 12:30pm. The repairman, John Campbell, was fantastic. 

Initially, John thought the issue was our A/C's transformer and unfortunately he did not have the part with him so he called his colleagues in the area to see if we could get the part brought to our house. After further inspection John found out the issue was actually our float switch. By 2pm we had cold air blasting through our house again!

John could have charged us an arm and a leg for his Saturday visit, but he kept the price as fair as possible and we now know to add bleach to our A/C to avoid this repair again. If we ever need our A/C repaired again we will definitely call Hot 2 Cold!",2017-05-12 18:26:30
6DrKoAxWowKnJEG6alpHhg,1,"Wow. Where do I begin?
Lets start at the top.

I booked my appointment online & they let you choose different time slots & each time is allocated to one of their fitting rooms & how many people I can bring.

1:00 Suite 2 (+3 people)
1:00 Suite 4 (+2 people)
2:00 Suit 1 (+2 people)

It looked something like that. You choose your time & you choose your suite based on availability and maybe how many people you are bringing. So basically from the beginning the feeling is (you better not be bringing too many of your friends). Which I was only bring my MOH so whatever. I chose my time at 7PM on Wednesday night. 

Then the confirmation of my appointment arrived via email and reminds me that I ONLY GET ONE HOUR in the shop and it urged me ""to arrive early or on time so that you get the most out of your 1 hour."" This is the shortest bridal appointment I have had so far, most places say appointments are 75 minutes or 90 minutes but they also prefaced it with  (if you go longer thats no problem!) Lovely's vibe was ""you get one hour & one hour only because then we will kick you out"",

So I arrived early, 10 minutes early. I buzzed the buzzer with my MOH & we were greeted by a frantic stylist who ushered us in & told us to wait & that she would be right with us.

So far no problem, we were early, so we would sit on couch. Cool. At 7PM she came back and apologized that they werent running on time and that we need to wait on the couch still.
Now I know they have several ""suites"" as I booked online and I could have chosen one of several 7PM appointments for other rooms. So i assumed my suite wasnt the one running on time. But when the other bride finally left at 7:20 (when we were allowed to start our appointment) I saw that another stylist had been helping them, so why couldnt my stylist help me at the same time and put me in a different suite? There were at least two stylists there and I think 3 or more different suites and only one other bride. I did the math.

Now lets back track for a moment to where we were still waiting in the front room. I got a little antsy at about 7:10 & walked back into the salon to just start peeking through the racks. As my MOH & I approached the first rack the girl (her name is Aleza) stepped out of the office & asked to please wait in the front room. I asked her if I could start looking at the dresses & she didnt say ""no"", she said ""I will go through the dresses with you when the appointment starts"". So I asked, ""can I look at them now anyways to just start to get ideas?"" (BTW there was no one in the show room but us the other bride was back in the dressing room) & she said no because she wanted the other bride to have space & not feel crowded by my MOH & I. 

So back we sit for another 10 minutes. Then at 7:20 my appointment starts.
Aleza asks me the feel of my wedding & my budget, which I tell her is $1500-$3000.
She takes me to the racks & starts to point out some dresses. She is pointing out things that are not what I described to her that I liked but she goes rack by rack with me & I try to start to look at things on my own and she is very disapproving & tells me that she wants to take me through every rack first, once we get through all the racks I now have ""permission"" to look through the dresses. My MOH & I start looking & when my MOH found something she thought I would like she tried to take it off the rack (keeping it on the hanger mind you) & show it to me, the stylist scolded her & told her not to take anything off the rack. 

As I started to find dresses I wanted to try on, she also told me not to take them off the rack myself, but she also wasn't taking them off either to go & hang them in dressing room, after selecting around 4 dresses & her not moving from her spot I said, ""are you going to pull these for me?"" she said, ""I will pull them once you are finished selecting them""  I replied, ""wow you can remember them all exactly?"" & she said snootily, ""yes, I have been working here a long time, I know the dresses really well.""

As I go around the room I make it to the last rack of dresses & point one out that I want to try on & she says ""that one is out of your price range"", she reminded me throughout the process which were out of my price range. The dresses have price tags on them, I see the price. If I ask to try it on, let me try it on.

ANYWAYS, we get to the fitting room, I am NOT a modest person, I dont mind if another girl sees me naked. But I had been to 4 other appointments before arriving at Lovely & all the stylists gave me the option of modesty, letting me step into the dresses myself & then they would come in & zip me up etc. She stood in the room the whole time & didnt let me touch any part of the dress. I have never felt more judged or vulnerable while being naked in front of a person.

This was a full on bad experience from beginning to end. I left other apts hugging my stylist, I left there in a bad mood.

I've started learning a new dance, and realized that somehow my dance shoes shrunk.  I was planning on making a trek to the city when my dear cousin, we'll call her JazzyC, told me about this place.  Yay!

Motions is a store in a nondescript small building situated across US-1 from the Pilgrim Gardens shopping center.  Their building is wedged between a car dealership and a donut shop.  I drove past it once without seeing it, and I was looking for it.  

The store is in the second floor of the building, there are both stairs and an elevator.  The store is bright and clean with good flooring to test dance shoes with.  I was greeted warmly and shown where their ballroom shoes are.  I was advised they have stopped stocking ballroom shoes so what they had was out & discounted.  

I was then left to browse.  I tested a few pairs that didn't quite work for me.  The salesperson came back to check.  I asked about character shoes.  Yes, they kept these in stock. They are only eliminating ballroom shoes - character, tap, ballet & Jazz/hip hop we're staying. We discussed my concerns.  She brought out a pair that fit well and felt great.  Boom! 

I wandered over to the costumes & dance gear, idly looking through the adult items.  What's this?  A great dress for a Renaissance Faire in my size?  On sale?  I was shown the dressing rooms, where I tried the dress on as decided it was great.  Double boom!  

My salesperson cheerfully processed my transaction, and I went home happy.

The place looks about the same as when last here several years ago. Still clean and full of red and white leatherette booths with chrome around the trim. This time staff was more attentive, bringing orders from the kitchen promptly and offering to refill the coffee mug as they passed around the dining room. 

My Hercules Omelet was a three egger variant of a Greek, but with Gyro meat (beef/lamb) in place of sausage, and spinach, onion, tomato and feta. Large half plate of home fries alongside. I liked it a lot, especially with a squirt of hot sauce all around. Coffee was strong, too, with the requested milk rather than creamers. 

It is quite possible that the same regulars I saw last time where still hanging out. My server looked like the woman who helped me before. She seemed to take a proprietary interest in the operation.

It is located in an 'alley' called Arizona Ave and the new Johnny Gibson market will be next door. While the inside is small they have a large patio where they have music on certain nights.

On to the drinks.....
The Le' MASQUERADE is probably my favorite as I like vodka and sweet drinks.  But I also tried THE CONTORTIONIST which was fun as they place this vodka martini in front of you, add pop rocks and cotton candy on a skewer is placed across the top of the glass. The cotton candy begins to spin and go into the drink - so fun and it tastes great too.  They also had a peach vodka ""sphere"" in a peach puree shooter that was so darn good that I could have sat there all night shooting those!  We also tried the ELBULLI BUBBLES PRICKLY PEAR MARGARITA and the ""bubbles"" are like tequila bobas - amazing!  We also tried the BEARDED LADY which was cognac with coffee bean and orange rind infused in front of you!

ZDCWEctaQHfJQT1sH_rMmA,5,"Wow, talk about some of the best deals I've ever seen on grocery items.

Grocery Outlet is as budget as they come in Santa Barbara. There's really nothing else like it. I'd consider it a mix between a gleaner and a normal grocery store, erring more toward the glean side.

The deals are remarkable, but you have to inspect each item's date. I once saw a vat of applesauce for 25 cents, with a regular price of $6.99. Wild! The catch - the sauce had expired two days prior. Due to the mere discounts, this is not the type of place that you can negotiate a fresher item for the same cost. Everything is priced low, and you as the consumer just have to go along with it.

That being said, I have found a bevy of really good deals here. Not all of their items are on the verge of expiration. I like how the selection gently rotates, so that there are always new deals to be found.

Don't come here if you're seeking a traditional grocery store experience. Do come if you are on a tight budget and are ready to be impressed by some serious deals.",2018-11-24 19:31:09

Yes, it has nice accommodations very comfortable beds.  Yes, the service personnel were accepting to my needs, Yes, the hotel restaurant was nice, as was the breakfast spread and a Starbucks's in the lobby. 
   But there is one thing that truly bothered me to no end, This was the great numbers of homeless people that were able to use the hotel as a passage, bathroom break, warming spot, and the lack of security persons to either keep them out or moving along..
   The center for criminal justice, ie. the court house, was just across the side alley this allowed all walks of life to come in the side door to the hotel, day, night, weekend or other, to use the facilities as they seemed fit. This happened without any intervention by hotel staff. Many tourist were foreigners and maybe couldn't ""spot"" these persons getting on the elevator with them and waiting for the foreigners to use their key cards to gain access to the floor or just ride the elevator till it stopped on a particular floor ,..?

pou3BbKsIozfH50rxmnMew,4,"Why 4 stars? Because even a non-museum guy like myself, enjoyed my visit.

   ---   ---   ---

I have never been into checking out museums. I don't know what it is (or what it isn't) but I feel like a museum brings out the worst of my ADD. I seem to get bored, and want to speed walk through them, rather than take my time and soak it all in. A great example is: I love baseball almost more than anything else in life, but I really have no desire to go to the Hall of Fame. 

There were definitely moments where I felt that here, but also plenty of 'WOW' moments, as well. I have the same artistic ability as my dog, so it always amazes me when you can take in the work of people who see the world so differently. The most impressive exhibits were the double paintings, where there were two completely separate paintings within one. Which one you saw, all depended on your own interpretation/perspective. I can barely draw a circle, so the fact that Dali could paint two paintings within one canvas... I'm surprised we even share the same species.

I highly recommend the audio tour, rather than the guided tour! It allows you to move at your own pace, which comes in handy when the ADD strikes :)",2015-08-21 04:38:36

Looking at the menu, we came in and expected an enjoyment of tastebuds but left very unsatisfied. I was not impressed at all with the execution and the food tasted very mediocre. The espinacas has nothing but a few sad leaves of spinach that's barely cooked and looked like a side salad without dressing. Champinones al jerez is just mushrooms and nothing else. They must be running out of garlic and shallots because none of our dishes that supposed to have those ingredients came with it; this made the vegetable dishes extremely plain. It's not acceptable because we came in at 6 pm which is just the beginning of dinner time. The Iberico tartare was pretty gross tasting and I couldn't eat it. Patatas bravas and the Spanish ribs were just okay and nothing special; but considering the execution of all other dishes, I think it is already an achievement for this restaurant.

When the contractor went to pull the floor boards out from the bathroom downstairs behind the toilet, they pulled it out and realized that there was water squirting out from behind the walls.  turns out that there was a nail shot throught the tubing for the washing machines.

Imagine a place with the speed and cost of a drive-thru, but the chef's look like they work for a gourmet steak house.  Thas' cray.

Yes in fact, PDQ is cray.  I was shocked by the appearance of the chefs because they were all decked out in their nice chef costumes, and not just wearing grungy cargo shorts while hiding in the back.  They were very present in the front of the house, as if they wanted to be seen so that they could show off their nice threads.

After eating PDQ, I feel like every other fast food spot needs to re-examine their entire business plan.  Many people have pointed out the soda fountain with all of the different combinations - don't get me wrong, that thing is cool, but there is something much more clutch at the PDQ.

A hand-washing station outside of the bathroom!!  Whoever decided to install this, must feel like the first guy to invent TiVo - what an obvious and wonderful addition to our lives!  I like to wash my hands before every meal, but I often feel like going to the bathroom can be counter productive, as you are entering the dirtiest place in the building.  After washing your hands in a bathroom, you aren't able to pull the ""open the door with your foot"" move upon exiting, and you end up more gross than you were before you left the table.

As for the food, it was great.  I really liked the chicken, loved the fries and can never complain about a nice variety of sauce choices.

Together we have been working on skills that will allow Matthew to become a more independent young man. We have visited Cutters Corner together at least 10 times. Normally seeing one specific Barber two other times seeing one other Barber. This last visit on Saturday Matthew went alone. Nervous yet excited to do it on his own. The woman that normally cut his hair was there but did not take Matthew another barber who had never cut his hair before brought Matthew to her chair. She gave Matthew a number 3 buzz cut over his entire head. Keeping in mind it is November and it is cold out and that was never the cut that he ever wants got. Not to mention the other Barber never came over to help her with the situation to let her know his normal haircut. Needless to say my son was so very very upset with this haircut it caused a whole new set of problems. I don't think I'm being oversensitive as a father I think in these types of people oriented business this type of situation should have been handled much differently.

vhMMA4vymXwtoTbIrD1g6A,4,"I had an issue with aphids and scale on a variety of trees and bushes around my home.  Called around for quotes on eliminating them.  One vendor in particular, Massey, was all about sending out a sales guy instead of a technician and trying to push a high pressure sale on me for things I didn't ask for, getting me on an annual contract, so on and so forth.

Executive Turf Management was recommended by a vendor who was re-doing some of my irrigation and noticed the bug problem to begin with; I had assumed things were turning brown because of the watering problem, but he showed me the bugs all over some of my plants hiding under the leaves and eating them.

In any case, called in the afternoon, a technician stopped by the following morning.  He walked the property with me, clearly explained what the different bugs were, made recommendations and gave me a price.  He didn't try to get me to sign up immediately, didn't mention a contract, and even told me the price would be the same if I did it as a one time or an ongoing engagement.  I told him I thought the price was reasonable and wanted to go ahead with the one time option, when could they do it; he said immediately if I wanted and I could just call the office and pay by credit card if that was my preference.

Had the treatment, my plants are bright green again after just a week, I can visibly see the bugs dying off and clearing out from the leaves.  I'll likely repeat every few months as a preventive measure, since waiting until your plants are browning is not particularly good for them.",2017-03-30 15:05:13

Galen is now FULLY ACCREDITED!! So no more using that as an excuse to not go!
Yes- it IS a tough program but guess what? I never failed a single class. You have to be dedicated and willing to give it your all and then some. If I can do it with two sons under the age of 7, so can you!

When hubs found out his nephew and his new wife didn't plan on having a wedding cake (¯\_(ツ)_/¯) after dinner, I came across a few that were closed for the Holiday season- but we certainly lucked out on this one on Cypress St in West Tampa. Hubs stepped it up and got them one they would appreciate to celebrate their special day. 

Aside from the long-standing history here, hubs ordered and paid by phone from NY with ease. And when we came here to pick up the cake, the smell of sweets was all around even with my mask on. Glass shelving with fig bread, cookies and unusual pastry+fruit combinations I've haven't seen at any NYC Italian bakery I've been to. 

The price is right, service is plentiful from any counter you go up to and the Strawberry Shortcake hubs got for his nephew was very good. The cream seemed like a lot on top- but it was actually good, the cake itself was spongey-soft and strawberries tasted like strawberries.

But I have found, that I usually have to wait 10-15 mins (also, they don't take reservations) so I recommend getting to the destination ahead of time, or sending someone ahead to get a table at those 'busier-than-usual' times.

TK_bfkEq72MWMuOxd7eCtA,5,"I was fortunate enough to get served an ad to come try this Aussie Grill location before it opened. I signed up for a 4PM spot during their soft opening. I was the very first customer. Ever. 

I chose the drive thru option and I could tell the new staff were excited to greet me. It was very cute. I placed my order at the window: a cheeseburger, fries, and a cookie. 

The menu isn't very large but it serves its purpose for a bit more of an upscale drive thru. Center cut sirloin anyone?

My classic cheeseburger was delicious! And the Outback signature, salty fries were just as good as the sit down restaurants. 

I'm thrilled this location is so close to me and will return to see how they do after the grand opening next week.",2021-12-02 21:30:26

Today, was an awful experience, this place is NOT my favorite, never has been for many reasons. 

Today's nail guy was Henry.... He rushed through my pedicure, I told him he was hurting me at least twice, and as I walked out and my toes are smudged. Our experience was horrifying;  we were skipped over twice while waiting with our feet in the water, the first chair he gave me did not work, and he was going to let me sit there until I told him I wanted to move..... Everyone around us was offered a water, or soda.. We were not. 
Positive side was I was able to enjoy the company of my friend, we had great conversation.

We love the spicy aioli and unagi sauce. The topping are so playful and will match whatever mood you're in. If you want sweet, try mango and pineapple. If you want spicy, they have jalapeños! 

For the kids, you can choose 1 protein or pay for more if you want! All I only is this place is delicious and everyone should give it a try. It's sushi in a bowl. Can't really go wrong with it!",2022-01-06 02:53:17

1G8DBWBOX5zRAn3MQwjh0g,1,"I've been a customer at the same
Location for over 20 years. (I think it has changed management more than once). The quality of there muffins has gone down so badly. Their Banana Nut was my absolute fave. It was the bomb. It tasted like my mom's homemade banana bread - super moist, tons of banana flavor, and plenty of nuts. I also use to enjoy the Carrot Cake muffin. It also tasted homemade. 
I've had both kinds of muffin recently and they were awful. So bad that my husband forgot I didn't like them anymore and he brought me one on Saturday and I refused to eat it. I just couldn't force myself to do it. 
Both flavor of muffin tasted weirdly the same. They tasted like the same batter/mix was used for both and they actually tasted like it could possibly be the same base they would use for a corn muffin. Both the carrot and banana muffins were dry and tasted almost exactly the same. Both had nuts and the carrot cake one had a weird glaze topping instead of the usual delightful cream cheese frosting. I don't know if the muffin mix comes from corporate like this awful concoction or if it's the franchisee cutting corners to save money, but either way both muffins are a horrible representation of this company. 

And one other note - the customer service has also gone downhill. I get that on the weekends, it's probably high school kids working that don't want to be there but a company needs to know who they put into positions as their representation of their company. The staff always acts completely put out by customers ordering food. They take no pride in their work. Again, this is just to let the owner know how their employees reflect on their business. Poorly, they reflect poorly....as do the muffins they make.",2022-01-10 06:14:06

I went to the bar to see if I could pick up my order there since there wasn't anyone up front. They told me I had to go back to the front. Overall, I waited 25 minutes. And by the time I got back to my house with my food, the food was soggy and cold from sitting in queso and beans.

We came for dinner around 5:30pm on a Friday night, stood around in the entry way and had to call out ""uh...hello?"" before anyone came out to give us further directions on where to sit.  The staff were nice, but seemed pretty green.

The spanakopita was good, but my falafel sandwich was lacking :(  I asked for it to be spicy and the wait staff told me that wasn't an option.  Likewise, the sandwich had giant chunks of yellow iceberg lettuce in it and was really dry.  I would say the saving grace were the fries, but the ketchup bottles on the table were so gross and had dried ketchup crusted on them that not even that helped.

We went here on a Sunday evening, and the place was mildly crowded, showing it's popularity. The servers were prompt and we got our table in less than 5 mins.

A yelp checkin does get you a free plate of ""fish balls"", so do not forget that!! Besides that, we ordered garden fresh wraps and Tom yum fried rice- the rice was tangy and a bit spicy which we loved. We went vegetarian and so we asked for tofu with our fried rice and the server obliged. Almost anything can be made vegetarian so do not hesitate to ask. All in all, we were happy with the food. I loved their peanut sauce which comes with the garden wraps, super yum!!

Overall, we enjoyed our dinner there, the only thing is the order does take time to prepare to be patient. Otherwise, a fantastic Thai restaurant, would definitely visit again!!",2019-07-22 13:51:38

The meals are easily good for 3-4 people. For $24 we got 2 slabs of ribs,  hot potatoe salad loaded with bacon and a gigantic portion of coleslaw. At any restaurant it easily would of cost $60 plus dollars. On weekends they smoke some brisket or Montreal smoked meats and I definetly want to try them.

We were hoping for a new place so close to home, but when we got there realized it was must a new name and slightly new decor but the same management.  The owner purchased a very successful pub and ran it into the ground by cutting corners to lower the food costs.  Over time the regulars stopped coming and eventually so did we.  

When we saw the new name and decor we decided to try it and were greatly disappointed.  My husband requested his burger to be well-done.  As you can see from the photo - it was pretty far from well done.  This is a stunt they used to do at Smees too.  My sides were cold and the meat in my grilled pork tenderloin was not only tough, but very poorly trimmed.  

The decor wasn't well implemented either - oh, and sit in the booths.  The fabric seats on the east wall are not user friendly!

However with Black n Brew not too far away, and hooking all of that up plus brunch and breakfast burrito I'm kind of inclined to lean toward them (and not just because I need to stop in and see if my friend Carly still works there!).

bJ5FtCtZX3ZZacz2_2PJjA,4,"I remember a time where legitimate good pizza in Philly was more or less an unheard of. So when places like Pizzeria Stella, Barbuzzo, Zavino, and Santucci's (who I am super belated in reviewing the northeast location of) moved in the area; it was a beautiful revolution that I was happy to be a part of despite somehow slacking on visiting all of the above (So many places to check out overall!). But with Birra opening up less than 4 blocks away from me, and people like TJader of Philadelphia Slick (check them out fool! - http://www.facebook.com/Philadelphiaslick) holding it down for them; it became one of those places that I was destined to hit up sooner than later. and in the end I'm happy to say that I had a taste of that fantastic pie!

On my first visit my crew and I went traditional by splitting a Margherita and a Caesar salad, and both lead up to being simplistic tastes of pure decadence. When Vinny and I made it down for a dose of Happy Hour before Beer NN' Board Games 2.0 we were pleasantly welcomed to the Gabagool and its taste of spicy capocollo and cured tomatoes. if you don't feel like going traditional you can order any of its major pizzas in bowl form. or you can order from their list of many panini and plates. But watching them flip the pizza dough in the open kitchen is one of those feats that truly need to be witnessed if your sitting bar side.

Beer wise Birra definitely impresses with a tap list that rotates daily, and an amicable selections of cans and bottles.

Camellias burgers are even better.  If you are looking for an amazing burger, look no further!

sRayUe6Y_YSXOK7pKfdlBg,3,"Tons of top-roping, lead routes, and space... route-setting and bouldering, just ok.

I belong to PRG in Oaks, and have been to the other climbing gyms in the area (PRG Valley, Vertical Extremes, Doylestown), and decided to check out Go Vertical last saturday afternoon with some climber friends.  Go Vertical has some advantages and disadvantages compared to the others, but overall I wasn't thoroughly impressed.  Maybe I expected too much from ""Philadelphia's only rock climbing gym, and the largest of its kind on the east coast"".  While it's the only gym in the city, there are plenty of other options in the burbs.  If I lived or worked in the city, I'm sure I'd join GV.  But I work out in KoP, so Oaks it is.

In regards to the ""largest of its kind"" claim, that is probably GV's best asset.  There are over 200 routes, and plenty of top-roping and lead options.  The lead arch that spans over the gym is impressive, though I didn't do any leading during my visit.  Plenty of top rope routes to choose from, and the 50 ft high section of wall was unique.  The overhanging bouldering section was small (lots of problems, but close together so only about 3 people could be on the wall at the same time.. I imagine this gets crowded).  However, they also have bouldering all over the gym, just watch out for other climbers.

I wasn't impressed with the route setting though.  Routes seemed unnecessarily difficult and lacked footholds. On easier routes I found myself simply muscling moves b/c there weren't footholds or I couldn't see a clean way to do a move.  On more difficult routes for me I'd fall sometimes, not b/c the move was too difficult, but b/c the move was awkward or didn't have sufficient footholds.

Not crowded for a saturday afternoon.  There were plenty of people there (~30?) but the gym is spacious and we didn't have a problem finding a variety of open stuff to climb.

In regards to other yelpers comments: The staff were friendly (only interacted with a girl and guy at the desk), and the ropes and holds did seem on the older/dirty side.

Parking note: Apparently they used to own the lot next door, hence the ""plenty of free well-lit parking"" claim on their site.  But Sugarhouse casino took over all the lots, and you can't park there without going to the casino (think they patrol the lots and tow).  There's free street parking around the gym, but I can see it being difficult to park during more crowded times.",2011-01-27 16:49:38

The portion sizes are big and you always leave full and happy! The place is decorated with bears all over which add to the charm. The place is always busy which is a good sign and a favorite of many locals. Open for breakfast and lunch I have yet to have a meal I didn't enjoy. My new favorite meal is the open faced turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy. They even serve it with cranberry sauce and it reminds me of Thanksgiving! Love this place!,2019-10-05 02:36:16

SSlW0LTQwER5obHjTW0ZIg,5,"My Husband and I decided to stop into Hook and Press while we were on a Mini-Moon in Santa Barbara.  We arrived around 10:15 on a Tuesday.  John, the owner, was there and greeted us with a smile. There were plenty of each flavor of donuts left, which I was surprised as it was later in the morning and definitely after breakfast.  Score! (Donut shop tip: if you want the full variety of donuts, from any donut shop, you should get there in the morning). 

I am normally plain Jane when it comes to donuts.  I decided to go outside of my shell and ordered the Butterscotch Walnut Brittle.  My husband ordered the Maple Coconut Bacon Donut (no pigs were harmed in the making of this delicious donut!).  We loved every single bite.   The cold brew and Cappuccino also hit the spot.   My sister, a few weeks prior, had brought back some donuts from her trip to SB;  the Horchata and POG, both equally as delicious as those we tried on this trip, even when a day old (pop those bad boys in the microwave for 25 seconds and they are just like freshly made donuts).

We decided to sit on the State Street patio so that we could people watch and enjoy our sugary delights.  The ambience of the shop and patio are definitely SB local and it is worth sticking around to enjoy your treat.  Thank you Hook & Press, we will be back on our next trip!",2019-10-10 20:16:31

XUwYlVRuyoImgtaw8Cjztg,5,"I've been RE-BIRTH and came back as a FIEN (A FIEN for this place).
Ok so let me lay out the scenario.. I'm a super YELPer as I use YELP for just about everything and I contribute accordingly hence my Elite badges. I've been trying to get my husband to utilize the app sometimes in the chance that we want to grab something and I'm showering (just to be proactive). 
GUESS WHAT?? He took my advice and this is where we ended up. Can you say BEST DAY EVER (in my alien from the animated movie HOME voice)..

Our hotel was in walking distance so we trekked over and walked right in to this gem. Immediately we noticed a smiling host and a bat area and a nice intimate dining area which made is nervous because we didn't have reservations. The host ask if we had reservations and we replied NO. He informed us that they were booked for the night however we could sit at the bar and enjoy dinner. Can you say ""BEST DECISION EVER""??

We approach the bar and there were only two seats left which we quickly grabbed and the bartender Leonard was so AMAZING he introduced himself and got us engaged in convo with the othersi dining at the bar.

We started off with a fried oyster/ creamy mushroom pasta appetizer dish. Oooo Mmmm Ggggg it was ridiculously tasteful.
I had this seafood buttery dish with shrimp, crab, garlic, butter, tomatoes, fresh herbs, etc.. No WORDS
My husband had a specials dish of Fish over spinach with lump crab and a special sauce drizzled that put it all together. Let's not forget the fresh herbs bursting through with flavor.

I also had a Watermelon Mint drink and my hubby a GingerBeer.

For dessert we had the most amazing bread pudding to share. 

We were in town for two more days and since reservations were still booked up we decided to pop in to see our now FAV bartender/server and eat another DELICIOUS dish TWICE more before we left the city and state LoL.

This place is a MUST for ANY of our future visits and I will be SURE to make reservations in advance :-)",2016-07-07 03:31:41

vO1MrQHjE1auSiICMvvX-g,4,"This was my first visit to the stadium and I have to say that the layout is rather amazing! I have been to many baseball stadiums and always get annoyed when I cannot figure out how to get to the section but this place makes it simple.

The different types of food options they have is great too because they don't just have hot dogs, brats, and nachos. They have donuts, Ben and Jerry's, and even the Impossible Whopper! I know the whole vegan craze has been booming lately but it is impressive when I can get a vegan burger at a baseball game! Now, if only the Ben and Jerry's at the stadium served the non-dairy kind I would be in absolute vegan heaven!

The beer is kind of expensive to what I am used to paying at a ball game but hey, I get it. This is the only baseball stadium around so they can charge higher for it. Plus if you are getting a Budweiser at Busch Stadium it is basically getting it where it was brewed lol. 

The different places you can sit is really cool too! I have never seen where I could pay $10 and sit at a ballgame and not be so far that I can't enjoy the view/food. Although my tickets at section 135 were perfect and I could not ask for better seats! I am so glad this stadium is so amazing and that the Ballpark Village is right behind it so you can enjoy both. Whoever made the design for these places is a hero in my eyes!",2019-04-10 19:13:59
2YKkLFeOx-0zRcWp0KUv_Q,3,"You know that feeling when you're looking forward to trying someplace and you pull up, the parking lot is empty and the place down the street has a line? Your spidey senses start tingling and you start to question yourself... yup that's what happened here.

We'd driven past the day before on an errand and had to return to this part of town the next day so we thought we'd try it when we came back. Walked in and the place was fairly empty but the crowd seemed like regulars. 

I'm a sucker for good, hearty, rich breakfasts so when I saw chipped beef on toast (also known as SOS) I wanted to try their version. Nope... not on the menu anymore. I settled for the California omelette, with bacon, Swiss, avocado and tomato. I asked about ""Rachel's Taters"" and was told they were home fries. I asked it they were prepared with peppers and onions. The answer: Yes, but they could make them just plain. So, it's nice that they are flexible. The home fries were hot and crisp but the omelette was nothing special and the toast made from store bought bread was a little dry.

My wife ordered a standard breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausage and pancakes. The scrambled eggs and bacon were fine but the really large sausage links seemed undercooked - pretty scary. The pancakes were a little dense and not fluffy like she likes them.

I chatted with the server and found out that this place used to be a Jethro's and had been sold.. twice. They had kept most of the same menu items. So, basically, there's nothing original about this place. Because it's way out of the way for us, we're not likely to be part of the regular crowd here.",2015-12-31 16:39:20

dYJPAlkQx_K7WVfbg3aj7A,3,"Background:
- Came here on NYE, a Saturday night, winter time. 
- Party of 2.
- Restaurant has been around for 40 years.

Overall, I wouldn't be opposed to giving this place a second shot. Seems like they have their ways and are successful since they've been around for 40 years. In future visits I would be more specific about how I want my food prepared. I would also come here only under very casual circumstances...lunch, happy hour, Sunday afternoon food/beer date with friends, or if I just wanted specific seafood and was in the area. I would not celebrate any special occasions here as the atmosphere is plain. Read on for deets.

Atmosphere:
- Small restaurant. Pretty quiet. About 6-8 tables of varying size total. Orange/warm colored walls. Little to no decor.
- Very simple, ultra casual style. Good place to go if you want seafood, but don't feel like dealing with high-end prices or pretension.
- They played really romantic-ish music while we were there which was strange for the restaurant since it's very casual and it was NYE. Gave me the impression they tried to make up for the plain walls with the music.
- Quiet atmosphere. I could comfortably talk to my dinner date without yelling. 
- Because of the size of the restaurant, the 2-seater table we sat at was really awkwardly placed.
- Clean bathroom.

Food:
- I ordered 6 raw oysters as an appetizer ($9), and lobster and beef tenderloins for entree ($30). 
- The oysters were very good. In my mind, it's hard to screw up something raw! They came chilled over ice with lemon and a marinara sauce (standard). Shells about 3-3.5"" size - good size.
- The entree came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Lobster was a good size, but not tender enough. Beef was over cooked. Side vegetables were very good. Asparagus cooked right and bright green, and mashed potatoes, standard comfort food fare.

Service:
- The owner/head waitress/hostess (small place, so not sure) was very friendly. We had trouble spotting the restaurant from the street (it's very small and tucked in between a couple businesses) and called the restaurant for help. The owner saw us at the corner and navigated us to the restaurant over the phone.
- Our waiter was very nice, but seemed overwhelmed or distracted. Missed standard cues such as: introducing himself, clearing empty plates or glasses from table, didn't leave us with salt and pepper on the table (had to flag him down), served lobster without drawn butter (had to flag him down). 
- Spilled my martini on the table.
- Waiter also spilled water in front of our table and splashed us. Not too big of a deal, it was just water, but he already striked out a couple times.
- I mentioned that the beef was dry and all he did was quickly mumble, ""Sorry.""

Drinks:
- Ordered their specialty winter drink, an apple cinnamon martini ($8/9) and then a mango martini ($8/9). 
- Apple cinn drink was unique, but I wouldn't order it again.
- Mango martini tasted like it was made from actual juice. Flavor actually reminded me that of those huge cans of apricot juice. Would not order again.",2012-01-01 20:17:36
IVm1abIK9OWCsrkmEAM7iQ,4,"Wow, there are a lot of 1 star reviews for this place. Normally that would scare us off  but a coworker vouched for this place.  We have never eaten here before so my review is a result of our single experience with a Postmates delivery.  The wings arrived warm, with a crunchy exterior but moist interior. The Asian garlic sauce,  Salt & Vinegar dry rub, and the Kickin Bourbon sauce were great.  However, the disappointing sauce was the Habanero Mango since it lacked flavor compared to BWW's version. For fun, we got the kids mac n cheese which is just Kraft and some tater tots. Both met expectations.  The funnelcake fries desert was ok.",2021-11-21 00:16:31
rBeKFxV0PJ-wXMjaEa8G5A,4,"I went to The Cheesecake Cafe as part of a Yelp Event - Yelp Staycation #WildWestYEG.  I haven't been to a cheesecake restaurant in a loooong time.  I naively thought this restaurant was part of the big American chain ""Cheesecake Factory"" but I was so wrong. At the beginning of the event we met the owner and she described its history as a locally owned Edmonton family business.  It started over 25 years ago in their Calgary location and has been going ever since and expanded to Edmonton, Medicine Hat and Spruce Grove locations.

They focus on using quality local ingredients and they care about what they are serving. I was very impressed to hear their history because I just didn't realize they were a local Made in Alberta success.

As part of our event we had the opportunity to decorate our own pre-made cheesecakes! If you want to book a great party this is a great idea.  We probably had close to 30+ people at our event and it went very smoothly.  They provide an already baked cheesecake and all of the fixin's to decorate it up. We had a blast at our event.

The cheesecake I ended up with (the marble variety) was exceptionally good!  My decorating may not have been near as nice as anything they put out though but it was a great time.

If you are looking for a great place for dessert I highly recommend them! I am looking forward to going back and trying some of their non-dessert options and reporting back.",2015-11-27 01:49:31

The current releases have changed to a raffle procedure the week before the official release. Also, they currently receive a variety of Asics and New Balance shoes that other stores in the state don't receive. 

It's also the one of the few ""street wear"" stores in the city, which is evident through their apparel; including BBC, Staple, Hundreds, and others.

New Orleans coffee shops are often special places and this is another unique spot to enjoy your coffee and tea. This location next to Wisner Park was previously the old Laurel Street Fire Station and then it later served as a New Orleans Recreation Department Community Center before the city auctioned it off which led to us being able to enjoy some great coffee at Cherry Espresso Bar.   They serve some great coffee, tea and other tasty beverages along with a selection of baked goods.  This is a great spot to enjoy your caffeine and it has a good variety of seating options both inside and outside.

They were looking at our food most of the time, but it made us question if there was something wrong with our food. That made us lose our appetite. 

We were also getting looks from the kitchen. Maybe they were checking us out? Either way that is not the experience we wanted, especially since their tapas are not cheap. 

We had a reservation, but after being seated it took a while until a waiter came. It was probably about 15-20 minutes before we got water. 

We ordered a couple drinks, a few of the bites and tapas, and the seafood paella. My favorite was what ever tomato sauce was in the prawn tapa. My favorite was tomato sauce and bread. TOMATO SAUCE AND FREAKING BREAD. Everything else was ehh.

They are a tiny little place off of Metairie Road, just about across the street from Puccinos. Parking is limited. There are about 2-3 parking spots right in front that are shared with the salon, Glow. Since I came on Sunday, I thankfully had no trouble with the parking as most things are closed Sundays.

They have a small walk-up counter where you order. They offer drinks and desserts. When I came, there were only cake pops left, but it looked like they may have had pastries earlier.

I ordered my go to drink - an iced latte. It was good. I took it to go as it was a chilly day and I had places to be. They do have about 5 tables in front with chairs and umbrellas if you did want to hang out there.

Service was exceptional, our waitress was very friendly and we were checked on by multiple staff members throughout the night. They did the thing were they refold your napkin when you step away, which always makes the experience feel extra fancy.  We had the Fresh Quince cocktail which tasted like a boozy green juice (yum), and the ultra smokey Gilded Dram. The food was fun and interesting, all twists on traditional Jewish foods. Everything was delicious, no duds here. 

Standouts were the Borscht Tartare - I have no idea how they made shredded beets so fantastic, it's witchcraft. We had a complimentary dish of the potato latkes delivered to our table, which we had foolishly passed on when making our dinner choices. The latkes were extra crispy and the apple onion sauce made the dish work- don't overlook the latkes like we did! The braised chicken was also unexpectedly good, I almost never order chicken because I find it boring, but decided to based on reviews here. It was extra juicy and flavorful, and the parsnip kugel was perfectly paired. Finally please, please order the Bacon and Egg Cream.

Had the Jamon for an appetizer. Almost as good as you can get it in Spain. Entrees were steak, sausages, and mushroom soup. All were prepared well and exceptional. 

Highlight was the dessert menu. Our server recommended two very local creations, Baked Nevada and Pinion Tart. We could not decide between the two so we ordered one of each. The Pinion Tart was like a pecan pie but instead made from local pine nuts. Yummy. But the Baked Nevada is not to be missed. Lemony frozen custard on the inside with meringue on top.

1MwoiUajN2l54d4K9uTycA,5,"We had the most remarkable experience at House.  Supremely attentive, nuanced service.  The kind of service that only exists in white-glove exclusive restaurants.  Service that shows you what happens when the server does this as a profession, rather than a job.  What a treat.

Faithful Dining Companion and I ducked into House on a rainy afternoon for lunch.  We admit this was chosen over some other Media restaurants because there was a parking spot right in front.  Yeah, we can be shallow.    It was nice to come into a bright, clean, very beige-and-bare-wood with some cool accents place on a dreary day.  This place looks like Crate & Barrel at the Beach.  

Faithful Dining Companion got the Shiva salad, I ordered a bowl of chili and the King Khan salad.  Many happy noises were made about the Shiva salad, and the chili was all kinds of yum.  I didn't care for the King Khan salad, though it wasn't the fault of the restaurant.  It was I am certain magnificent for what it was, plenty of meat, creamy sauce served on a bed of greens.  It's just that the greens themselves had a bitter finish, something the haute cuisine set enjoy but I do not.   

Now here's the amazing part.  Our server, Jose, noticed that I was picking around and at the salad.  I did NOT fuss (FDC can back me on this).  I didn't even mention to FDC that I did not enjoy the bitter greens.  He just, well, observed.  He came, asked me if I was enjoying the meal, I said it was fine,  he probed, I confessed, he immediately offered me something else, took it off the bill, and refused to take 'no' for an answer when I insisted it was my palate, not the salad itself, that was the problem.  

For the service alone in this case I'd give it 5 stars.  Having said that, the food was awesome, so this is an easy call.",2013-07-13 12:46:52

Walking into Franklin fountain in particular transports you back in time to an old style ice cream parlor from the 1920s. Apart of the charm of this ice cream shoppe is the traditional clothing worn by the vendors and the cash only old ""timey"" register. But if you frequent philly enough you know to keep cash on hand.

They put a pretzel stick in the middle of the sundae which is pretty good twist on traditional sundae. Note it's a small place so it's probably not the best for a crowd.",2016-09-24 04:00:44

6He7CwCnjxeCN9Cs-X8i7g,1,"I used to like coming to this restaurant, but the last four times I have been here, the service has been terrible. I don't understand how it still gets so full, the wait time can be over an hour long at times, and they won't let you make reservations. They are super unorganized with their seating and will seat people that have come after you, or leave tables completely empty and not seat anyone. I have been denied mussels due to a ""town-wide shortage of mussels,"" which was a lie, we have been denied long rolls being made into handrolls. The last time I came here, we had a party of six, and ordered two orders of each mussels for each of us, as it is stated on their menu, on each of the mussels (baked and cooked), that it is two limits per person, but the server told us that it was combined,  not separate, so she brought us less. None of the servers are friendly, or smile, NONE, and maybe one hostess is friendly, at most. They all just seem so unhappy in their job, and in the way they treat customers, which leads me to believe the owner must be a terrible boss who does not appreciate them, or maybe underpays them, who knows! After experiencing such bad customer service over and over, I have no desire or intention to come back to this sushi place. I've had enough, and there are plenty of other sushi places where people welcome you and your patronage, and where the sushi is way better than here.",2019-02-28 02:10:45

If you are Filipino, then you know Seafood City.   

I don't think there is a Seafood City located in Reno, but this place comes close offering the basic necessities for Filipino's and for foreigners up for a little adventure in their lives.  

They offer a variety of Asian snacks, foods, drinks, home goods and beauty supplies. 

They don't have regular carts but have baskets on wheels which are located by the entrance.   It might be hard for the elder shoppers to reach down into the cart but I don't think that would be a problem because the people who work here are very nice.  

There are frozen, packaged fish in the back, and a little area for produce that you may not normally find in a regular supermarket like okra, and Filipino baked good fresh from California. 

If you own your own business, they do have some spaces up for rent.  

There is eyebrow threading for $8bucks here too!   Will be coming back again!",2014-08-20 23:22:08

Federal Donuts is steps beyond the mass produced chain donuts.

Sadly, I did not get the full experience with Federal Donuts. Had I known how quick the ""cool"" or ""fancy"" as they call them donuts sell out, then I would have been there MUCH-MUCH earlier. 

Also, their wings were already sold out for the day. No Bueno for me as far as the chicken. Perhaps in a future trip. 

We left with a stack of their most standard donuts and headed back to the hotel and they were pretty good. A LOT of sugar, seasonings, and even some salt in there.

I like the vibe of this place. The seating is different, but not atrocious by any means. If you want fanciful fixings, then why are you even here? They sell donuts and chicken for Christ sake.

I have an ice cream maker and and constantly churning out new flavors I can't get in the stores. Needless to say, I'm pretty discriminating with my ice creams, but this place absolutely ROCKS! 

We showed up around 10:30 on a Friday night, and the line was way out the door. I scoped out the menu then returned to my spot, eagerly waiting for my treat! This old-fashioned ice cream parlor offers traditional flavors along with some pretty exotic fruit flavors (banana, coconut, blueberry, black raspberry, teaberry, etc.) They scoop VERY LARGE, but I still decided on a 3-scoop large since I wanted to sample three different flavors! (You can mix two with a medium and only one with the small). Chocolate was rich and decadent, and peach was very flavorful, but the star of my order was the blueberry nestled in the middle. There were bits of blueberry throughout and the flavors were spot on authentic, without excessive amounts of sugar to mask the flavor! I also sampled the chocolate chip, and it was by far the best I'd have ever had. In addition to the chunks, they also added in shavings of chocolate to really add color and texture to the silky smooth vanilla base. 

When ordering, I'd suggest you pick the ""to-go"" containers (they look like the paper Chinese food ones) over their cones, since their friendly servers will cram more ice cream inside...I saw some people with the cones and can say that three baseball-sized scoops on top of your dainty cone will be one hell of a balancing act!

The cold soup (gazpacho) wasn't to my taste although the sizable helping of crab meat and the Pinot Noir helped;  others at the table liked it  The veal osso bucco ravioli was what I expect and paired well with the Napa Cab.

You can get a bag to take home or even have them make your sandwich on one. But get there early because they do run out of fresh pretzel rolls. 

The sandwiches from the bakery are so good and you have a lot of options. If they run out of pretzel their sourdough is an amazing second choice.

HuB6-5n480bnhtV6SHGUgQ,4,"This is always one of the best festival in Edmonton. It's great to see so many countries represented in the community wanting to share more of what they have to offer. It's always sunny and there are thousands of people having a great time.

I do have a couple gripes though. I always bike to this event because it's so busy and it's just so much easier. However, once I get off the Groat Bridge I'm never sure where to go. As they encourage so many people to cycle to the event, they need a designated bike lane into the park. If you walk your bike in with the pedestrians then you overshoot the bike parking area because the walkway is fenced off and then you have to back track. If you ride on the road, the lanes are separated by cones so they are very narrow and you have to go in the bus lane. It just seems like there should be some proper signage for the cyclists.

Secondly, I just went yesterday to the 2013 version of Heritage Festival and had 3 food tickets left. I went for the deep fried wontons from the Hong Kong tent. Worst decision ever. It was more like deep fried wonton wrappers. Instead of it being wrapped like a wonton, the wrapper was folded diagonally in half into a triangle and had a tiny piece of meat the size of a dime. It was pretty gross and was nothing close to a wonton. I am actually offended and insulted that they are serving this and calling it a wonton!",2013-08-07 03:58:12

pII1_yXhZf3bOteJs6g1tg,1,"""You can't eat a bad meal in New Orleans""
That's what so many friends tell me and that has been my experience in all the times I've visited New Orleans. 
That's why I didn't check Yelp reviews before walking into this place. 
Big mistake. 
This place is a tourist trap. We ordered our drinks before I decided to look around the room and spot the signs. Everyone eating here was obviously from out of town. Visors, fanny packs, and ""family reunion"" t-shirts at every table. 

I hoped that maybe I would get lucky and have a decent experience. 
Here's how that played out for me:

Our drink orders were too complicated for the waitress. One diet coke, five waters, three beers. But one of my friends called her after and told her instead of one beer he wanted another. I was ready to bet my first born that both beers would arrive at our table. Would've had twins if I did. 
Next, the food. It took a very long time and our food came out in episodes, with two of my friends getting their food first, then the third, then a long time after that my other friend and I got our side dishes (without our main course). So I sat there watching everyone eat while nibbling on some frozen food section fries. Eventually our food came out. 
The food was passable. I guess that's the only upside to our trip here. Passable. I was able to finish my shrimp po-boy. That's a difficult dish to mess up. My friends ordered breakfast items, which are also difficult to prepare incorrectly. 
The bathroom was absolutely disgusting and there were no paper towels. 

Hilariously, After we were all done eating, the biscuits and toast were brought out, like some kind of punch line.

I'd say the bill was the last straw, but I can't. You know why? Because I'm still waiting for it to arrive.",2015-06-27 17:53:04

The crust tasted kinda bland, actually everything tasted different, the cheese and sausage where notably different from my previous experiences.  I know they are suffering from product availability, the staff had a small sign posted of some items not available and when asked made it clear, things just aren't available.

iWN029DJxACyv5pmJMyjVg,1,"-I am beyond frustrated at the lack of communication & unresponsiveness. The customer service from this company has been terrible. I should not have to be chasing a company down to get a response. I will find another company who respects me, my time and my money. The past month has made it clear that UWD does not care about their customers or their satisfaction.
-I had an installation appointment scheduled for Saturday, 6/1 between 8-10AM. I received multiple emails the week before confirming my appointment & received one the Friday before reminding me of my appointment the next day. On Saturday, 6/1, I waited for the installation crew, they never called and never showed up. I called the office around 10:45 to find out when they would be arriving since they had missed their appointment. I was told the operator would try to contact the installation crew & find out. Over an hour later I had still heard nothing back from UWD, so I called the operator again. I was informed that she could not get a hold of the crew. I said I would assume no one was going to show up for the day. 
-On Monday, 6/3, I received a call from Stephanie asking how my installation went. I told her that they no-called no-showed. I was told by Stephanie that she would look into it and give me a call back. I never heard from Stephanie again. 
-On Wednesday, 6/5, I received an email asking me to take a customer satisfaction survey ""now that my installation is complete."" At that time, I had told 2 different people that my installation was not complete, yet no one updated my customer file to reflect that. That just solidified how unorganized this company is.  After taking the customer satisfaction survey, I posted a review on Facebook about my experience so far & said I would not recommend UWD. On 6/5, UWD replied to my FB review with the following comment, ""Amy, we are so sorry to hear this. It is always our number one priority-to make sure the customer is completely satisfied. We have heard your voice and want to take care of you. We have let a member of our management team know. Thank you, UWD Customer Service"" I never received a call from their management team to ""take care of me"" as they stated in their response. 
-On 6/5, after my FB review, Bryan, the person I had scheduled my installation appointment with called me and said today was the first he was hearing that my installation had not occurred because he had been out of town. He said he called the installation crew to ask why my windows had not been installed. Their response was that they had my windows loaded onto the truck but were having truck problems. They did not call me because they did not have my paperwork with my phone number. If they did not have my paperwork with my phone number, how were they even going to find my address? Usually all of that information is on the same paperwork. Also, if they really did not have my phone number, it would've been just as easy for them to call UWD's main office & ask them to call me and tell me they were not showing up. I understand that things happen & appointments need to be changed, what I don't understand is why no one could have the courtesy to let me know that my original appointment was going to be missed. Bryan then told me that he would get back to me on the same day to let me know when he could get me on the calendar for an installation. I never heard from Bryan again after that phone call.
-On Saturday, 6/15, I received 5 missed calls and a voicemail from Darrel saying that he was loading my windows for installation, but because it was raining the caulk would not be able to dry so he would not be able to do the installation. I told him that I was not at home and in fact did not know I had an installation appointment because I had not heard from anyone at his company in 10 days. For my previous appointment, I received multiple e-mails saying when my appointment was scheduled & reminders leading up to the appointment. This time I had not received any e-mails or a phone call to tell me they had scheduled my appointment. Darrel told me to get a hold of Todd on Monday to schedule an installation. 
-On Monday, 6/17, I called Todd to schedule an appointment for installation. He told me that he would try to get my on the calendar for 6/29, but would call me back by the end of the week to confirm because he was in town from Ohio & would only be in town through the end of the week.  I also explained to him all of the above that had happened to try to get these windows installed & asked him who I could talk to about my issues to rectify the situation.  He told me that he was the guy because he was ""pretty high on the totem pole"". He said he would see what he could do & again reiterated that he would call me back by the end of the week with an installation appointment & an update on what they were willing to do to take care of me.

NnIx35qoj05L92dcqarEIA,3,"I want to start this of by saying that my stylist Michelle was very talented and I could tell that she knew what she was doing. I was apprehensive to even write a review because the condition of my hair in the beginning was due to me being bored during this pandemic and impatience. But I was not satisfied with the end result, especially after spending around $280. 

There were a couple of things I was not happy with and I felt maybe the biggest part lacking was communication and that is vital in any service role. 

My hair was damaged, I bleached a lot of it myself and I also have hair that has had dark dyes added for years so the lighting process was sure to be hard plus there was color correction needed. Michelle told me that my hair was compromised but she would do her best to get it to where I wanted it to go, which we both understood may not happen today. That was fine, I know I can't take damaged hair that is half light brown still after 3 bleaches and half blonde and expect an even platinum. 

I showed up at my arrival time, but ended up waiting an hour to get started because she had another client. I took this in stride because I knew that the industry can be like that at time. I finally sat down and we talked and discussed my hair and goals. 

I told her I knew it was damaged and I wanted to chop it all off and my goal is platinum with silver and some lavender. She wanted to cut it first and then work on the color. We started the bleaching process. After that we rinsed and she mixed up color. Now, at this point I think communication went out of the window. She brought up 3 bowls and when she started applying what looks like a very violet color, I asked if she was toning it and she said yes. I was ok with that, because she applied it to my roots and I was a little concerned I was going to have some violet hair which was the opposite of what I was asking for. 

Now, she also added a smokey color to the ends, in an attempt to not only mask the brassiness but also because even though she was able to pull the ends from the much darker brown, it wasn't platinum yet and we both figured that wold happen. 

We went to rinse, and this is hour FIVE at this point, somewhere at 7:00pm for a 2:00pm appointment. It was my birthday this day and I had people waiting on me at the house and I was pretty much ready to go and Michelle was working a double so we were both at the end of a long day. 

We go back to the chair and my roots are violet purple. The mid parts of my long pixie style cut, the top/bang part are much lighter, a bit brassy but that was understandable. You can't create miracles on compromised hair. 

We went forward to dry and finish the cut. She thought I wanted something different, we ended up taking some more hair off the sides and it still wasn't quite what I was looking for so I pulled out my phone again. This was another place communication was lacking. We should of talked much more on the hair cut so that we didn't go back and forth so much, I began to feel that Michelle was starting to get a bit frustrated because I wasn't happy with the look of the short style. Mind you, I just went from slightly past the shoulder length hair to a very short style with bangs. So at this point I did want to just finish and I tried to talk to her about how I actually wanted my hair and about next time are we gong to be able to get the purple out and do it more toward the ends because that's what I actually wanted. I felt that she was done with me at this point, and to be honest after 5-6 hours on one head, I understood to a degree and I also wanted to get home for my birthday festivities. She added a texturized to my hair, it gave me the look I wanted and we parted ways. I get home, and of course my husband gave me compliments as dd my friends but my husband talked to me later and said he didn't know I was going for something so dark and he thought I was mainly going for platinum blonde with lavender and silver. I told him that was the goal and we can't get to it so fast, but that I also didn't know why I had violet purple roots. 

I asked her at the end if taking this purple out would be a problem and she said it wouldn't. But I will definitely talk to her and tell her my side of things and also ask that we communicate before doing anything involving color or cut and be sure we understand one another. 

My advice to anybody is to communicate fully, don't assume that because the stylist is talented that she knows exactly what you want. This was our first visit together and we have to learn one another like any relationship but I am not fully satisfied and feel that the color could have been avoided with better communication.

Had I known when I asked if she was toning my hair that it was actually a violet dye, I would have tried to fix it then but after so much time went by it was past the point of fixing my hair and fixing color that day.",2020-12-05 14:35:01
Lt7xSv-7QIhKrctrXEwvxA,1,"Horrible from the time I made the reservation. Called the restaurant a week a head of time to make a reservation for my sons 21st birthday (his choice) they told me I needed to use Yelp to make the reservation. Yelp only allows up to 6 people we had 7. I made it for six and called the restaurant back, they said it wouldn't be a problem just tell the hostess when you arrive. I received my text the day before to confirm which I did but was worried about the sitting so I called the restaurant back again to make sure having 7 not 6 people would not be an issues. I was told you should be fine but if there was a problem ask for the manager. Not the answer I wanted but I said fine because this is where my son wanted to go. We got there last night (7:30 reservation) I went to the hostess and was asked if the 7 of us wanted to sit in a 6 person booth I said no there were 7 adults, I was told I then needed to be put on a waiting list since I had more people. Needless to say I was not happy and went over how many times I called to make sure 7 people would be fine. I was then seated at a long table which was perfect but then it went down hill from there. I get restaurants our short staffed but if you can not accommodate the reservations you are taking don't take them. I'm still paying the same price.  Our waiter was nice but mia most of the time. Water brought to the table when we sat at 7:30 we left at 9:30 - no water ever refilled and never asked if we wanted any drinks. Took our apps and dinner order together my son then asked for a drink as well as my husband. My sons came but not my husbands. Sat for an hour finally 6 of the 7 dinners came out - they forgot my sons order - we thought his just wasn't done until the waiter came back awhile later to ask if everything was ok. His meal did not come out until we were all done.  We were so frustrated and angry by the end no one even wanted dessert. They said they would take his meal off the bill. Bill arrived they took one steak off but still charged us for his first order so nothing taken off and charged us for a second drink we never received.  The manager came over to question why we were questioning the bill but he did not realize the whole issue with my sons meal. I was absolutely done at this point. The manager apologized and also took my sons apps and  drinks off as well. I never asked he just said he would. On top of it we drove an hour for this fiasco with my 80 year old parents. I wouldn't give it one star but you can't post without one.",2021-10-23 10:25:21

WuXBLay-Aek06VP4cZzFew,1,We decided to go to the O'Fallon IL Chevys  on 10/14/2021 for our anniversary meal and it was a disaster before it even started. I asked to sit in the bar area and the manager said she could not because they were already four tables and not enough staff so we had to sit in the dining room. When I asked for the happy hour menu the server said I could not have happy hour prices because we weren't sitting in the cantina bar area. I asked for the manager she came out and said I heard you have a question I ask why we could not have happy hour prices because we were sitting in the dining room and she reluctantly said she would give us happy hour prices and I said that's the right thing to do and then she started arguing with me saying I never said that wasn't the right thing to do she got in my face she waved her hands at me she got very aggressive so we got our things and left and then she ran out of the restaurant trying to apologize and I was having none of it. We will never ever ever go to this restaurant again. This is shameful behavior from a Manager. If I could give this no stars I would. Too many other places to go.,2021-10-14 23:15:56
NLoqvArgYHa6Jjz-Hg2xvw,5,"We were invited to a birthday party at Wonder and unwind this past weekend and It was incredibly refreshing and made me wish there was somewhere like this 8 years ago when my oldest was a peanut. 

The concept is incredible, different rooms for toddler/baby age kids to explore, play and get their wiggles out! The rooms had a few different themes and the aesthetics were beautiful. I had the ice ice baby iced coffee and it was delicious too! So even more perks! I also felt like it was very clean & bright & you could tell this business is soo well loved. 

In regards to the party, my friend said once she picked the theme they took over and planned and decorated everything out - which guys, it was incredible, from the cake to the decor to the poster on the wall with the child's stats - it was all lovely.

4yKYyXHpMCvU9lABCZlfZA,1,"!!!!ZERO STARS!!!! 
       They only get one because that's my only option!!!!
  The sales staff will tell you anything to make a sale and promise you will be paying less but I guarantee you they are lying. They conveniently leave out details that are very important. The general Manager is incompetent and unwilling to help you at all.. Elite wireless group should be shut down for fraud! 
      My wife went to the store and was promised our bill would be $25 less and if we had any problems to come back and they would fix it.  The next month  our bill was $250 more but no one could figure out why and no one would fix it at the store. One of their shady employees had added an extra line from an old phone that was on my plan in 2012 by doing this I lost all of my loyalty credits from Sprint and Since this store wouldn't help me I was held to a two-year lease for a phone I didn't even have and was paying $30 a month for an IPhone 4s I had in 2012.! When I went into get it figured out ""Amanda"" the manager told me she couldn't help me. She said The employee that did this to us had been fired because he was fraudulently doing this so he could get credit, he had done this to multiple people  and that she talked to the district manager and that he wasn't willing to do anything either. I tried contacting the district manager. No luck! I called sprint fraud department and they couldn't get the district manager to call them back to figure out what was going on. once they get you to sign the paperwork you are screwed and you are held to a two-year lease. When you try and get help from them it will not happen.  If you call Sprint to have it figured out and sprint calls them, they will lie through their teeth and say anything to get themselves off and make you look like an idiot.
      Sprint fraud department even agreed with me that what this store had done to my account was not how they should have handled it and seemed shady to them which then led them to open up a fraud case against the store on my behalf. I am talking to my lawyer this week to see if there is any legal action I can take against this store to help stop them from doing this to other people. I filed a complaint with sprint and I am calling the Better Business Bureau to file a complaint with them as well. As a business owner I am appalled at the stores actions, their blatant disregard for customers and and the laziness of their general manager who couldn't return one call to help settle this.
            I have been a sprint customer for over 18 years and thanks to this business I am switching off of Sprint!! 
Do yourself a favor read the reviews on here and you'll see the similarities of our stories and  how we were lied to by this store and it's employees.!!!
If you must go to a sprint store go to the corporate store by the mall.",2017-07-02 05:08:30

As it is hard to find Vegan options in restaurants we asked the chef for something special and he amazed us by accomodating this request and then created one of the best vegan dishes I have ever had! He even came out to see if we liked it or not after the meal. We have been back a few times since then and they now have vegan choices on the menu. The crispy tofu is amazing! Great service with good looking staff this is defintely a place to eat at if you want gourmet food and attentive staff.

yf1H6T1fb06lq2bNYLZaPg,3,"If you're going here for drinks, you'll enjoy your time. If you're going here for amazing food, you might be partially disappointed. 

The lobby was so loud that you could barely hear the host speaking, so it was difficult to understand the host's instructions of where to go for our table. After we sat down, we ended up waiting about 10 minutes before any server noticed us. I tried to hunt one down, but they seemed very busy. 

We ordered the guacamole starter, Denver scramble and breakfast burrito.

The guacamole was so sad. It was pure mashed avocado (no salt, no spices or fresh cilantro mixed in), with corn, sesame and cheese. It lacked brightness and flavor. Although, the chips were fresh.

The Denver scramble was decently tasty. It came with a side of sourdough toast and ""hash browns."" I wouldn't call those hash browns though! It was a hybrid of hash and mashed potatoes mixed together, which was an odd texture combination for myself, personally.

My partner ordered the breakfast burrito. Maybe I'm biased because I'm from California, but when you get a breakfast burrito, you typically get a large burrito! This was a small breakfast burrito - maybe half the size that people usually get back west. My partner wouldn't have been full if we didn't order the starter and if he didn't snack off my meal too. 

Overall, the food was missing that ""wow"" factor when it comes to flavor for me. I probably won't come back unless I have a guest visit Nashville that prefers less daring and blander American food. I don't mean that in a bad way - I'm just someone who prefers to be wowed by the flavors of the food a bit more. The Hampton Social just didn't do it for me. 

Otherwise, this place is beautiful. It's definitely popular with the young crowds and it's very ""Instagrammable"" mainly due to the lovely decor. People are taking photos of themselves as you walk in and out of the restaurant.",2021-02-28 22:31:20

eWybZmo5BZl3cp6v4_L7rg,1,"I've been a customer for over 30 years.  Unfortunately the service has dropped dramatically. Unless you want to wait 40 minutes to be picked up after your flight arrives, go elsewhere.  The last 2 times I have used the service it has been close to a 40 minute wait for the driver to bring my vehicle to the airport.  Last night I called immediately upon reaching the baggage claim.  It was 8:10PM.  At 8:48PM the driver arrived.  The lot is 10 minutes away from the airport tops.  I'll live with a 20 minute wait, but that service is unacceptable.  The driver, (who was courteous and friendly as most of the drivers are), admitted he had seen us by the pick up area when he made an earlier pick up.  He said it was the ""luck of the draw"" that he was assigned to pick up the other party first, but then had to return to the lot with the other customer, then grab our vehicle.  So basically they had one driver for pick up.  Another Pacifico driver was inside the doorway waiting for a shuttle to return to the lot, and admitted ""something's wrong"" when I complained.  Another Pacifico customer was there as well waiting an extended time for his vehicle/pick-up.  Meanwhile a competitor, Parking Spot, had buses running every few minutes.

yeoYsWOaBygXM095J8mvXA,1,"This store is very conveniently located closer to my house than other UPS Store options. 

I mailed a package from the Prince and Campbell UPS Store to my son on October 13th, 2021, who is in Army basic training in another state. 

On November 3rd, 2021, I get a phone call from an associate at the store letting me know that the package was returned to the store. 

I asked why that would be because I've mailed him packages since September 2021 from my usual store at Wetmore in the Best Buy shopping center, and never had an issue.   She said they attempted delivery, but no one was at the house.  I let her know that my son was stationed at an army base and that her explanation doesn't make sense because there's always someone there.   I told her I'd be down to the store to discuss further and that I need to get the package to him. 

Before going to the store, I looked up the delivery history from the tracking number. It showed that the delivery driver made one attempt and no one was there so they dropped my box off to a UPS Access Point and waited to see if my son would come to pick it up before returning it back to the Campbell/Prince UPS Store.

First of all, my son is in basic training on an army base and cannot leave.  Secondly, why would they have not made 3 attempts to deliver the package?

When I arrived at the store to discuss what transpired, the store manager Luisa was extremely dismissive. I asked her why the address was indicated as a residential address and why was only one attempt made to deliver the package?  She said that's up to UPS how they handle things. I told her that's her company,  could she look into this for me?  Again, she was dismissive and treated me like I was keeping her from something. There were only 2 customers in the store (myself and another person that was being helped by one of the other 2 associates in the store and who was not happy with the way she was being treated and overcharged)  so, I'm not sure why Luisa was treating me this way. 

She said she'd be willing to ship it for me, but wouldn't cover the costs; I'd have to pay full price to ship out again.  I asked her if I could get a discount or something because this was not my fault,  I was paying for a service that was not fully accomplished by her company.  Again  she didn't care and was dismissive. I asked if we could file a claim to get my money or some of it back.  She told me she'd have to call to file it since it was sent out of her store.  I assumed she'd call them in front of me to make me confident that she was doing something about this or at least tell me that she'd contact me with a resolution.  No,  she simply walked away to the back as if I was keeping her from something vital. 

Her lack of customer service and dismissive attitude is the reason I left the store, drove further to the Wetmore store and sent my package from there. 

Luisa is in the wrong position.  She is in a customer service industry, yet shows zero care for her customers. If I was the franchise owner I would be frightened about the amount of business they're losing due to Luisa. I'm only saying this because within my visit, the only 2 customers in that store were both very unhappy with the way we were both treated (we discussed outside after exiting the store on the way to our cars). I  can't imagine how many times per day this occurs with Luisa in charge. 

Anyone reading this.. go to the Wetmore store between Stone and 1st. The franchise owner works out of that store, and is very nice, patient, and actually likes his customers.  He was willing to help me out with my transaction and listen to my story to ensure I wouldn't be dealing with an Access Point issue again, since I never requested that service to begin with. He did all this while there was a line of the door and didn't for one second make me feel rushed or that I was keeping him from anything.",2021-11-05 05:30:53

I had already given my three girls their gumbos I took a huge spoon of macaroni because I love macaronis and was almost about to swallow when I realized they were slimy and tasted like I don't know blue cheese or something anyway it was obvious they were spoiled this is I'm getting up to spit the food out trying to stop myself from throwing up my girls come to me and see if they're gumbo taste it funny I took a sniff and it too was sour! called the manager he  gives me an attitude and says you people (Blacks) are always trying to get over and hung up on me over $45 worth of food down the drain none of us could eat it and the manager refused to cooperate with me. I WILL NEVER EVER EAT HERE AGAIN AND AM TEMPTED TO CONTACT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH,2021-08-17 22:12:58

We were seated within 30 minutes. The restaurant was packed the entire time we were there. Our waiter Kenny was warm and attentive. I had the Imperial Spritz and my husband had Smoke on the Water. Hand crafted yummy cocktails at a reasonable price! We shared the tartare as our appetizer- it was light and the flavors paired so well together. My husband had the scallops and I had the Scallibut. It was a really creative dish.. I can't say I've ever had halibut with seared scallops on top before and it just worked! We shared the chocolate mousse bomb with raspberry coulis for dessert. It was very decadent but balanced out by our shots of espresso. If you're visiting New Orleans, this a must in regards to a splurge fancy sit down meal. If we're ever back in the area we will most definitely return and make sure we have a reservation so we can sit in the dining room lol.",2021-12-01 03:55:51

PnEmn8uAf-XLBDLTPdxdhA,3,"So, to be honest, I was not that impressed. Coming from the Southwest and having spent extensive time in Mexico, this is not authentic Mexican food. At least not from what we ordered: nachos and a burrito. It was more like store bought items that you could throw together yourself easily without a lot of flavor. The burrito was a wrapped flour tortilla (not corn!!), with some sautéed veggies and beef thrown in that was seasoned with chili powder. The nachos were just melted cheese and a few jalapeños on hard, unsalted, flavorless white corn chips--the same chips that were brought to our table with liquidy salsa. Salsa should be chunky! And the atmosphere was very noisy and crowded, and the huge dining room very bright. Not much ambiance. We were squeezed into a tiny free-standing table between other diners and the kid next to us kept running around our table (I know. That's not the restaurant's fault, but maybe if we weren't all so crammed in. That's greed)... The only reason I'm giving my review 3 stars and not 2 is the frozen margarita. Very tasty and I was a bit buzzed off of one! Good bar tender:)",2018-09-08 20:54:31

Well, when I called to place the order, the lady was EXTREMELY rude to me on the phone, as if I was bothering her.  I asked if we could replace the soup on the lunch combo with an egg roll and she scolded me and said ABSOLUTLEY NO WAY! Like she was scary!! And then I had to fight with her to get her to separate the checks!  All of that was just over the phone!  Then I get there to pick up the food.  Oh boy!  I could see directly into the kitchen as I was paying for our food...did not like what I saw.  But I gave them the benefit of the doubt, hoping it was just clutter and not filth.  My co-worker and I both used our debit cards.  When I was paying with my co-workers card, and didn't leave a tip..the lady was obviously upset about it.  So, noticing that, I left her a tip when I paid with my card, and she didn't seem thrilled with the amount of tip I left.  I am usually a good tipper, but she was so rude, she's lucky she got anything.  Now on to the food...OMG! The wonton was so hard it could've broken our teeth.  The crab Rangoon was also very hard and gross.  The sweet and sour sauce given to us for the Rangoon tasted like straight beer!! The rice was dry and the General Zoal's chicken tasted like it was yesterdays, or even last weeks chicken, dry and rubbery!!! Needless to say, we will never be going there again.",2018-01-25 16:51:34

Oh and yeah, they are going to close about 5 days or maybe more during the week of Thanksgiving because that is a great time to close- no one ever works out after eating around Thanksgiving. Super poor management. Coordinate your closings and make notices of such more accessible and visible. Good grief- you have a worthless app you could try and improve upon by posting this stuff.

Yes it's pricy.  I would give it a 4.5 star if I could just for that. But I really want this place to stay, so 5 star it is.

Everyone has their preferred bases and extras with juicing. That's the beauty of Gangster Vegan.  You can always find something familiar and works for you, and something new to try.  Everything I've tried so far are 5-star worthy.

The Truth Juice - My morning tropical drink.

Core Juice - Great on weekend morning, especially after a late night out and drinking.

BluePrint Juice - My pick-me-upper in the mi-day.  

Funkdafied Smoothies - My go-to Smoothie because I love Goji!  Great energy booster and taste delicious.

Soul 4 Real Smoothie - all kinds of berries.  This is my favorite smoothie.

ODB - My favorite meal here. Nobody makes broccoli burgers this good!

Goji balls - Did I mention I love Goji?

Acai Bowl - Found it on the ""Special"" list.  I would have this everyday if it wasn't this expensive.

The place is small with only 2 little tables so it's a straight takeout place for me.  Call in first if you're in the hurry since they don't have everything in the display case.

pmdQY47wI6LSA7KokLVXgg,2,Let me start by saying I try to always give a business a chance to make things right before I post a poor review because we all deserve the benefit of the doubt. My sisters ombré nails looked good ... I believe it was Helena who did them. Me did my pedi which was pretty good but my dip manicure was very poor. I am used to them being filed down to look thin and natural. They were chunky and looked like blobs on my nails. She also left dip/polish stains all over my fingers and cuticles. She got a new client while my top coat was drying so when I asked her to clean them up she rushed and still left a lot behind for me to clean off myself when I got home. Given that they were so busy I wasn't going to make a fuss and was going to try and call to schedule to come back in so they had time to actually fix them. I went back today (the next day) to try and get them filed down more and to look more natural. Unfortunately Me was the one to do them again ... while they looked a little better they still weren't great. As soon as the rain hit my nails when leaving the top coat got these weird white splotches ...I sat under the dryer so they should have been dry and she told me I could leave. Typically after my dip is filed down there is a sealant or something that is put on before the top coat. I don't know if because she didn't do that it caused the issue.  They also look rough with file lines all in them versus smooth like they usually are. I was really hoping after I got my nails fixed I would consider going back in the future but I think I will continue the hunt for a good nail place when I am visiting my family here.,2021-12-28 18:14:40
y_4Us9aQzEjeLkyvzULcrQ,3,"This is a mixed review based on 4 experiences here.  All were 18-inch, take-out pizzas.

The first 2 visits were amazing!  The first being just pepperoni and the second a supreme.  They were really great and easily deserved 4-stars, with terrific crust, tasty sauce, and plenty of toppings.

On my 3rd visit, upon arriving home I discovered my pepperoni pizza was way overcooked and the bottom was burnt.  Ok, everyone is entitled to a mistake.

On my 4th visit, again the bottom of my pizza was really burnt.

Those 2 burnt pizzas plus tips equals $45+ down the drain.  Eh...

I think they may be the ""victim of their own success"" here?  They can get crazy busy and when they do, it is obvious that their quality suffers.

I'll try them again in a few months, but I'm going to check if the bottom is burnt before I leave.

pou3BbKsIozfH50rxmnMew,5,"Why 5 stars? Because I want Moonlight Boba in my life often.

   ---   ---   ---

I recently sent my wife the Moonlight Boba Yelp listing because her office is not too terribly far away and she loves boba. The reviews are pretty amazing, but I'm not in Pinellas Park very often, so I figured she'd be able to enjoy it before I would. Fortunately, we actually happened to be in the area, so we stopped by and I'm completely in love after one visit. 

At first, my wife just had me run inside and order a taro boba for her. I planned on grabbing a couple drinks to go and heading home, but I saw the waffle ice cream concoctions on the menu and thought that it would be much better to eat-in. Every waffle looked amazing, but the 
""Rainbow In My Hand"" with cotton candy ice cream, gummies and mochi's really caught my eye.

The saying ""explosion of flavor"" is cliche, but I don't know any other more accurate way to describe this. You got creamy, sour, sweet, mushy, hard and dense in every bite. It's quite a lot for your taste buds to process, but I liked it. With that being said, I'd opt for something like the Cookielicious or the Snow White next time, just for a bit more continuity.

Also, my coconut boba smoothie and her taro milk tea were both top notch.

But then as we were leaving, my wife pointed out a sign off to the side that showed ice cream boba's. And I have to tell you, outside of a sign that said, ""Brett, you've won a new car,"" I don't know if I could have been happier to see that particular set of information.

I'd recently been introduced to ice cream boba's in San Francisco and fell head over heels in love. I was told that they only recently made their way to the United States and were super hard to find. I knew that probably meant I wouldn't find them in Tampa Bay until about 2024, when they'd be old news in SF. So to find them about 3 weeks later in Pinellas Park, I was ecstatic. 

I'd already had a small dessert before arriving at Moonlight Boba + ordered a boba smoothie and an ice cream waffle here. I wanted to fully enjoy this ice cream boba, so we hopped in the car, drove about 40 minutes home to Tampa, froze them and ate them the next day. They were still just as unbelievable as I remembered, despite nearly melting away in the car the day before. Do yourself the greatest favor and go to Moonlight Boba for many things, but especially for the ice cream boba's before they sell out!

As I said, we aren't in Pinellas Park often, but if timing/circumstances work out, I know exactly where I'm coming for my sweet fix.",2020-02-18 11:47:10

pou3BbKsIozfH50rxmnMew,4,"Why 4 stars? Because it was a tasty lunch for a non-vegan like myself.

   ---   ---   ---

Full disclosure: Not only am I not a vegan, but I'm pretty much the opposite of a vegan. I almost never eat a meal without meat. But I also always going to go out of my way to check out a restaurant with a 5-star average and 200+ reviews. So I took my vegan pal along with me and headed over for lunch.

We were greeted by a super friendly person behind the counter who gave us a full rundown of the menu. I opted for the gyro, a side of mac-n-cheese, a chickpea curry patty and a cookie butter milkshake.

The milkshake was by far and away the highlight for me. I'd absolutely come back here again to try the other flavors. I honestly thought it was just as delicious as any legit milkshake. It was slightly lighter, which made it easier to drink, but not so light that you felt like the quality was sacrificed.  And as someone who is a bit lactose intolerant, my body was grateful for the dairy alternative.

My favorite food item was definitely the chickpea curry patty. I'm all in when it comes to curry and those really hit the spot.

The gryo and the mac-n-cheese - while not unenjoyable, I'd much rather just eat the real version. A few days later, I ate a real gyro and it was a pretty stark contrast.

I'm glad places like this exist for those who prefer alternative diets and hope they continue to do well. I'll be back in for milkshakes in the future!",2019-12-19 15:23:43

But today I was served noodles so bad  I won't be going back or recommending this restaurant to anyone. This is why. I ordered off the lunch menu.I picked The King and I noodles with a special sauce shrimp, chicken, squid, straw mushrooms, it was suppose to have  bell pepper in it which would have at least given the noodles some zip. But they were omitted without a word from the waiter as to why? I asked to sub rice noodles for the usual spaghetti noodles for an extra 2 dollars which brought my plate of noodles up to $12 which was OK with me. When I got them they were lukewarm. The special noodle sauce consisted of fish sauce and about a quarter cup of sugar. no salt , no garlic no cilantro or black pepper to give the dish any kind of flavor. Ick! The dish was so sweet. To top it off the frozen squid strips tasted slightly freezer burned. I think the chef (and I use the term loosely) may have been trying to cover up the fact that the squid were slightly off by making them taste sweet like good fresh squid should be. But what I got was candied squid, chicken, mushrooms! I asked for sambal and ground red chili to make the dish more palatable. But it did not help much.

gWZETLPu_ihAtLOYtrm0mw,4,"I visited Mei Mei for the first time to celebrate a friend's birthday. They accommodated our party of 7, and let us know that it may be a squeeze at the booth we requested, but when we arrived we felt comfortable.

They have a great happy hour from 4-7 PM, so we were able to enjoy about an hour of it. We initially ordered one of each of the happy hour food items, and we were impressed by the portion sizes, especially with the Korean fried chicken bites.

For drinks, I had the Pear Margarita, and it was simultaneously strong and delicious which is always appreciated for a discounted HH cocktail. Others had the Ginger Daiquiri and ultimately switched to the Pear Margarita.

One disclaimer, which is the reason for my one less star than perfect experience is that the General Tso's Chicken and the Sesame Chicken are essential the same exact dish. We ordered both, and had to ask the waiter first if we were brought two of the same dish. Then we asked what the difference was in the sauces, because we were not able to discern this on our own. Our waiter asked the chef, and reported back that the main difference is that the General Tso's should have more of a kick while the Sesame is more orange based. We could not tell the difference, and I'd recommend that if you're between the two to just flip a coin because the flavors are identical.

Beyond that, the chicken was delicious. The side of long beans we ordered were great, as were the veggies in the Old City. The star of the food menu was easily the Mei Mei Fried Rice. The sausage was insanely delicious. I am craving it while writing this review right now. I would order that for takeout, and return just to get a bowl of the Mei Mei Fried Rice for myself.

Our service was super attentive, and brought out a cake with a big sparkler for our birthday boy. There was an automatic 20% gratuity added to our tip (likely due to the table size) and that was totally earned.

I would love to return to try the weekend scene at Mei Mei.",2021-10-14 16:57:29

This is one of the best restaurants I've been to this summer, and one that I can't wait to return to enjoy (unlike others, where I felt I 'should' go back just to give a second chance, e.g. Kanella and Bibou).

The food is everything others here have raved about.  I'm an omnivore (tho I try to limit red meat), but never thought vegan could taste so good, and be so creatively and beautifully presented.  The flavors and presentations were Wow-some.  The standouts were the shaved brussel sprouts (from the dirt menu) -- best brussel sprouts ever; and the golden beet terrine, which was served with a vegan dill sourcream sauce and some capers and diced avocado --together the textures and colors were reminiscent of smoked salmon; it was divine; the maitake mushroom was meaty, mushroomy heaven; the radish sampler was presented as though it was sushi/sashimi at a Japanese restaurant. Less impressive was a summer bean dish and sweet potato fois gras on the dirt list. Some of the yellow wax beans were tough, and the sweet potato fois gras was pureed sweet potatoes (albeit presented nicer and with a foam or sauce.  These did not impress.

For dessert, we tried the sorbet trio, and the cheesecake.  The sorbets were flavor-popping, especially the strawberry and the tangerine.

It's not inexpensive, that's for sure.  But to me it was worth every bite.",2013-07-21 13:29:24

The girl taking order had attitude.  Glad the mask covered what was surly an unhappy face. The food.  Catfish was pretty good.   I would get that again.  Chicken was mediocre at best.  Greens were mush straight outa can.  Nasty and shameful.   Too easy to make fresh greens nowadays.   They come clean and precut in bag.  So that's totally lazy.  And gross.  And more expensive using canned!!!  Frozen fries.   Coleslaw out of a waxed box.  With all that I would not go back.  Lunch for 2 $30.   Nawwww.   Not again.,2020-09-11 19:03:01

I2owOyPHlcXYfhXr8hvodw,3,"So, myself and my person decided to try something new in Center City and we were feeling a little Asian fusion. We walked into this place and it had a very trendy, young ambiance to it. A lot of young professionals out on a Friday night--drinking their fancy cocktails and talking shop? Who knows. 

Anyways, we started out with a few appetizers to get the night going. I had a small bowl of Tom Yum soup, which I am always a sucker for and tuna avocado salad. The soup didn't have enough lemongrass in it for my taste, but it was still decent. But, the tuna avocado salad---boy, that was so good! Let me be clear, this isn't canned tuna, but rather delicious Ahi tuna. And they weren't skimpy with the avocado either! I would suggest ordering this!

Unfortunately, the entrees didn't give as much punch as the tuna avocado salad. My partner ordered the drunken noodles and asked for it to come spicier, but neither the flavor or the spice deliver. Whomp. I ended up with panang curry with tofu. Again, we asked for that dish to come spicier. It didn't come as spicy as we wanted. Maybe we have a high tolerance for heat, but I was disappointed with the final product. 

Overall, not a terrible experience, but maybe next time, I might have to try something different on the menu!",2015-10-29 00:58:39

If you ever been at the mercury grill in Dallas and eaten Chef Chris Ward mac and cheese I am here to tell you this one is better. I really thought no one could surpass the mercury mac and cheese but this one just kicked his behind. We also ordered a yummy big sexy burger and the whiskey ck on brioche. All fantastic all great. Service was on point and staff super friendly and knowledgeable. The owner Chris made us feel at home and spent time with us talking about exciting news about all the good stuff he is about to work on. We wish him all the good vibes anyone can get and please bring me some mac and cheese when you visit Dallas. And by the way their bathrooms are amazing and beautiful.,2017-06-30 22:22:10
ZtQr5DOhdD0yCJxal6oqlQ,1,"Service should be in the negatives - Arrived 1hr 45 mins after calling them. I called them after waiting 45 minutes and the person told me that the driver left already. Waited an extra hour and our pizza was near cold. I had to re-heat mines. Did not even get an apology. I understand it's in South Philly and I did not expect to be treated like a ""queen,"" but jeez louis. A simple ""I apologize"" would have been nice. 

Taste - Let's just say aside from being upset with the service, we did not want to have a second slice. There were 3 of us and we barely finished the first. We had gotten the vegetarian pizza and the veggies were disgusting. The broccoli pieces (they looked chopped up very well, or the leftovers after chopping a broccoli up) were discolored, onions were old, and ugh. It was just horrendous. My stomach was hurting so bad afterwards and I couldn't be more upset (especially since they're so expensive now). 

I have ordered there about 8 years ago and they were great. I think they fell off or got lazy. I don't know, but I will not be ordering from there ever again. I'd rather starve if they were the only restaurant opened that day. SORRY.",2013-04-06 03:24:15

I say sadly only because I'd rather shop for pretty than sweaty any day of the week...but I don't like to sweat and that's for another day!

Moving on...there are some big anchor stores - like Macy's, JC Penneys and Sears. Then, the regulars like Victoria Secret, Banana Republic and Ann Taylor. With fun shops thrown in like H&M, Francesca's and a great little jewelry store with alot of vintage goods down the hallway toward Dick's that you shouldn't miss!

We ordered the jerk chicken dinner (Large) for the price of 10.52 the amount they give you is very generous. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and the rice and beans is delicious. We also ordered two beef patties which are amazing along with the sweet plantains. We only had to wait about 10-15 minutes for our food which came out nice and hot (just how I like my food). It is a family owned restaurant which I love and the young guy that takes the orders and waits on you is super friendly and goes out of his way to help you!

EBNR8k6vxIJPnNXbQYC8Nw,4,"Florida sun. You've gotta love it. My family and I spent the afternoon on the beach recently. After soaking in all of the rays, we found ourselves extremely hungry (and sunburnt) searching for our next meal. That is when we stumbled in to Sea Critters.

It seemed that they were preparing for some sort of karaoke event, but we made our way through to find an open table on the outside back dock. With the open water, parked boats and smell of seafood, we felt right at home.

We arrived in time for their daily Happy Hour and took advantage of their $3.50 margaritas. They hit the spot. While waiting, our server brought a complimentary loaf of ciabiatta bread with a Mango Cherry chutney butter. The bread was fresh and very warm. It was on point.

While waiting for our main course, I made my way in to the bathroom. It was absolutely filthy and looked like it had been neglected for some time. There was plenty of staff clocked in that could have taken care of this at any time. 

The kitchen however was super quick. By the time I returned to the table, our Gator Bites had arrived. Boasting to be caught wild in Plant City, I found myself questioning the validity of that claim. Realistically, who cares? And how do you back that up? We're in Florida. Home of the Gators. They're everywhere! These were served up hand-breaded, fried and with a side of horseradish sauce. Pretty tasty, but much smaller in size than what I was hoping for.

I ordered the ""Hog Wings"". The menu describes them as ""fall-off-the-bone tender pork shanks served Buffalo or BBQ Style"". I chose the Buffalo style. Honestly, it was Franks red hot sauce. Again, small quantity. I found myself wishing I had about twice as much... And I'm not a heavy eater. It is on the Appetizer menu, so keep that in mind when you think it is enough to be a meal.

My daughter ordered the Cuban sandwich with fries. Maybe I'm a purist, but I didn't feel that it was an authentic representation of a Cuban. It tasted fine, but something was off with the pork. The fries were of the potato wedge variety. There were no complaints from my daughter.

My girlfriend ordered the Rockefeller Scallops Risotto. It was very soupy, but the scallops were cooked perfect. 

Overall, we had a pleasant experience on a nice Florida day. The server was quick and friendly. The kitchen was quick and accurate. We would probably eat here again if given another opportunity.",2019-07-03 02:51:17

When I go to ceviche I like to just go ahead and go cray cray ordering tapas left and right. One person could order and finish around 3-5 tapas depending on your appetite.  on this trip I started out with the champiñones al ajillo (mushrooms sauteed with garlic), and the bread goes very well if you dip it in the sauce that the plate comes in.  Then we moved on to the gambas al ajillo (amazing flavor), gambas a la parrilla (amazing los delish), batatas bravas (potatoes on a creamy sauce ""spicy"" according to them but is not at all... and its a must), albondigas (meat balls), almejas, ox tail (so tender and flavorful), chorizo al brandy and that was a perfect meal for 3.

MTiEYQ_LHH3xdxOKoXetfw,5,"I really enjoyed my first experience floating, and I'm glad I came here.

When you check in, the employee will show you around and explain things thoroughly, if you've never been before. 

The room contains one float tub, as well as a shower area. I'd start with the ear plugs. They offer two separate types of plus, foam and wax. I highly recommend the wax, and I also recommend putting it in first, before the shower, so you can make sure that it's in there well. You want to shower before you get in the tub, making sure that you dispose of all the oils on your skin. They provide the shampoo, conditioner, and soap, as well as towels. Make sure that you shower quickly, because as soon as the jet turns off in your tub, your time starts. Make sure to turn the room light off before stepping into your tub. 

In the tub, you have a spray bottle of water, a neck pillow, and a small towel.

You have the option of laying in total darkness, or with a soft light inside the pod. I did the total darkness, and enjoyed it, thought I did turn it on in the middle of the session because I got salt in my eyes. DO NOT TOUCH YOUR FACE in the pod. 

You'll want to steady yourself in the tub and be as still as possible. I ended up using the head pillow, and also leaving my hair down. 

It took me a while to relax enough, I could only hear my breathing and heartbeat. My breathing was off because I had recently been sick, so it took a while for me to be able to quiet my breathing. 

I ended up falling asleep quickly, and before I knew it, my light was on and my session was over. 

You have as much time as you need to shower and wash all of the soap off. They have plenty of things you could want... q-tips, towels, etc. 

The staff was very pleasant to work with, and were super friendly.

h3wz5HTdHH3RhCUpJWVGPQ,3,"Interesting place, but decor and ambiance aside there are a few items to note that make or break a business. Let's start with service. Somewhat friendly, but more standoffish arrogance then anything else. Get over yourself girls, you make coffee at a coffee shop, so how you treat the customer will determine if they return. In our case? We will not make the trip. That brings me to my second factor. Location. Not the best location to start with so if you intend to attract customers from other areas like Trinity, Odessa, Tarpon Springs, you better bring your A game and your service is your G or H game. The surrounding area is also not exactly one that makes you feel safe, with a trio of fighting drunk homeless folks on the corner in front doesn't help. The products (coffee and donuts) are average at best, despite the girl behind the counter bragging how she came from Starbucks and can make anything, and better. The price for two cups of coffee and two donuts was $15.00 which is way too high, so start adjusting down or you will find a drop in revenues.

--- location. This is a HIDDEN GEM. I guarantee that most of you have driven by this a million times and never realized it. I was actively looking for it, and still passed it...all you see is a sign, but the restaurant is tucked away. 

+++ appetizer.  I went with the tzatziki and avjar.  It's a half and half dish that you dip (and swipe) your bread. The blend meshes so damn well...the bread is a little hard...so if you have some dental issues, this could cause some problems. 

+ / - entree. Stuffed Cabbage, Paprika chicken: these dishes were weird, but I highly recommend mixing your tzatziki and avjar in with your rice. The paprika chicken was cooked well, BUT, the sauce reminded me of eating spaghetti O's. 

+++ dessert. I got the Bosnian shortbread and baklava. The shortbread is DRENCHED in honey and it is a top 10 dessert...of...all...time. The baklava is damn good too, but I've had too much during my time in Greece, but I had to try it  

+++ the staff. The chef even comes out and busses tables, greets customers, and even hands out candy bars.  I'm sure owners care about their business, but when the chef himself comes out and is a part of the team, this is what boosted this review to 5 stars.

Not gonna lie though, my first time there I did NOT put the right ingredients together. I did much better the second time. I really liked the Ju-ju taco shell which was the same concept as a Taco Bell double decker taco, but this was much, much better. I also had the firecracker shell, which again reminded of a Taco Bell item. Doritos locos taco anyone? This again was much better than Taco Bell. I was disappointed that there are no plain soft corn tortillas listed as a choice, especially in this gluten-free loving world we live in, but I'm pretty sure they have them if you just ask. 

I got cilantro and onions on most of my stuff and it was mostly onions with a touch of cilantro. I liked the jicama cabbage slaw better. My favorite protein was the shrimp. The ghost pepper marinated steak was good but the spicy-ness wasn't anything to write home about. I also tried the taco bowl with the ghost pepper steak, queso fresco, chipotle crema and salsa roja. It tasted good, but it was served cold which I didn't like. And with all that spicy stuff on there, I still didn't find myself reaching for any water. 

Drinks were good except for the skinny margarita. I wanted something with just the lime juice and tequila and not so much sugar. I should have known that something ""skinny"" would taste bad. It was also in a skinnier glass so you're getting less volume than the regular margarita. Regular pitcher of margaritas was pretty darn good though.

MOAg0h5YmoXbgTtQ69pkXQ,5,"Located in Laclede's Landing, Kimchi Guys brings Korean fried chicken to STL, which is prevalent in other big cities (NYC, LA, etc.), and I feel that they make a good version of it. This is what made me visit Laclede's Landing with my friends, which was an interesting area nearby the Arch. It is better to find street parking if you just wanted to eat there as most of the parking (expensive) in the area is catered for visitors to see the Arch.

Their chicken is double fried to give a crunchy exterior with juicy chicken inside. In terms of the sauce, I got the Spicy Original, which had spicy, tangy, and sweet flavors all wrapped into sauce. I feel that it is one of the best sauces that I've tried with fried chicken. I really enjoyed this dish a lot and it makes me look forward to try the other flavors that they have on offer. 

I thought the side that I got (the kimchi fried rice) was alright (and likely been made beforehand for a while as it was softer than other fried rice that I've tried). The waffle fries were good (had that seasoned exterior like Jack in the Box curly fries). They do have the radish kimchi, which is the classic condiment to Korean fried chicken. 

Overall, Kimchi Guys is a great addition to the downtown/Laclede's Landing area and should be one to try if you're in that area.

Porta has a very rustic appearance with bright lights and music that intrigue you to go in. I have been here several times for dinner and drinks. Porta's pizza is fantastic. I seriously cannot get enough. Some of the pizzas I have tried is the Carbonara Pizza, Margherita, Festivus, 14 & a half pizza, House Party, and Chenzino pizza. I have clearly tried too many of the pizzas on the menu but they are all excellent. I think the Carbonara pizza is still my all time favorite, but you won't be disappointed with any of the pizzas on the menu. 

The appetizers are also very good. I am a huge fan of the Many-Thanks Sliders and Meatball Sliders. Some of the other times that I have been to Porta were for the drinks. This summer they are doing The Twice is Right Tuesday's. Every Tuesday you can enjoy a bar crawl to four different bars in Porta Pizza and another connecting bar. At the end of the night, once you have you have all four punches in your punch card, you have a chance to win a prize! Some prizes include gift cards, free drinks, etc. I had a lot of fun during the bar crawl and met a lot of new people.  

Lastly, Porta just opened up the top Mezzanine. At the mezzanine, you can enjoy a great view overlooking Porta pizza, sit at the bar and listen to the DJ while enjoy some amazing artwork that is up there. I think Porta is a great option to go to any time of the week. They have so much to offer!",2018-08-04 17:47:21

He looked at my body and just told me there is nothing he could do but suggested I should do work on my face for $28K.  I am 56 years old female, I weigh 147 lbs and I am 5'11 tall.  I think he could have treated me more with respect instead of making me uncomfortable including with all the staff in the room.

I hear a lot of stories about him how he's treating women unpleasant.  I will never go back, that's for sure!",2020-02-26 04:10:38
6GO3anOoY-s5gHgaNg53_Q,5,"The chicken wings were crispy, despite being covered in a super delicious spicy Korean BBQ sauce, and the meat was ""fall off the bone"" tender and juicy. This type of ""perfectly fried"" chicken is tough to come by anywhere, so I highly recommend that no matter what else you order off the menu, you add a serving of their fried chicken, because it's genuinely phenomenal. The sauce had just the right balance of heat, sweetness and tang. We got Original! 
The big surprise out of the meal was the waffle fries. I kid you not- these were hands down, the BEST waffle fries I've ever had anywhere. They were perfectly done - not mushy or greasy - just perfectly crisp and cooked evenly throughout. Lots of great flavor and texture there. 
Of course, I had to get a Bibimbap bowl to try their Kimchi. It had a very fresh, ""clean"" flavor to it and went well with everything else in the bowl. Super delicious - you won't be disappointed. 
Kimchi Guys is tucked a little out of the way, but it was worth the trip! Staff was also super friendly, fun and super helpful with their suggestions and recommendations. Loved the interior design as well. Will definitely return.",2019-05-27 20:15:51

During the days, it's a local hangout from wealthy business people to construction workers.  This is one of the great things; everyone gets along.  Days on the patio, you can find kids playing Jenga, guys hanging out smoking cigars or women meeting after tennis and couple and their dog, having a beer.  Yes, they are dog friendly.  It's a testament of Tony having been in the business here locally for years.  At night, we'll then it becomes a mix of young people from all over listening to DJ music and overtaking the patio, enjoying the night through of a large garage door.

Raul who has been around for years, much of it in fine dining, has elevated the bar food with a flair.  You can have specialty burgers, taco Tuesday and awesome guacamole then finish it up with fried Oreos.

6Hmh8UC5K0oBgp3_D5doDQ,2,"Where do i begin. Overall the food was fine. I think this place and management needs to invest on their workers and get them trained a little more. 

Came in and got seated. Our waitress comes and asks for drinks and we ask for orange juice and water. Water comes but no orange juice. I ask them to substitute one the sausage and upgrade it to the large sausage and didnt get it. They eventually bring it and end up charging me extra FULL price not the upgrade price. Orange juice eventually comes after asking them for a second time and our waitress was super overwhelmed. She was not very professional in a sense she would talk with an attitude and yell across the diner. 

Honestly, if management just spent a little more time training and working on the employees' communication and other skills for this service I think this place would do fine. Until then, I will try another place.",2019-12-08 19:24:12
V3XYG1zKuW8VUBNtjacoxA,5,"We are huge Retreat fans! One of my favorite times to go is brunch time! Since our first visit, it quickly became a staple for us and our friends. It is definitely a Saint Louis restaurant I am proud to bring visitors to. 

The space and design is so comfortable and relaxing; the hospitality is always on point. From the kale caesar to salmon dishes, they have such a unique approach to making classic dishes really fun and interesting. 

Let's talk about drinks... I am totally a fan of their Mezcal Paloma in all its citrusy-smokey goodness, but that's usually a brunch choice. If it's happy hour or evening, you'll find me with either a Oaxaca Flocka Flame (can't quit you, mezcal), a Golden State, or a Full House. So many good options.  You have to check out their amazing local craft beer list. Truly one of the best lists in town, with exceptional sour options. 

Now onto my favorite dishes...The market fish is always a win. Mac & Cheese is uh-mazing. My wife loves their chicken sandwich. Also, get the rice bowl and add chicken! You won't regret it. 

Generally speaking, we always have a great time here, whether its a date or we are with friends. We're back every couple of weeks!",2018-04-26 05:15:22
6jjHo9Lilv3kTy87pm2ycw,5,"Just $5 every SUNDAY in October! Do it!

Oh, my my my. I gasped w/ each step into the 19 glass exhibits-- 9 national ones on the 1st floor & 10 international exhibits on the 2nd floor. There's even a social distancing theater on the 2nd floor; it showcases a ""Meet the Artist"" series. (I sat thru 3 autobiographies.) Each artist tells his/her story & shows how s/he creates such magnificent pieces. Just wonderful! 

I could be locked in this gallery forever & still be happy. This is an incredible museum for anyone who appreciates contemporary art-- most especially glass art. It opened w/ 500 pieces on October 1, 2018. It now showcases 1,500+ glass displays from over 9+ countries. Most are breathtaking. I want to return again & again & again..........& AGAIN! (I took pics of my favorites, although I LOVED nearly all of them.)

Admission is $15 for adults; $13 for seniors (age 65+); $13 for military (w/ ID); $10 for college students (w/ ID), $10 for kids age 7- 28, FREE for those under age 7, FREE for members, & visitors pay just $5 on Thursdays from 5 - 8 PM. Phone or look online for the OCTOBER SPECIALS! There is parking in front of the museum along w/ additional parking behind the building. 

Born in Virginia, gallery owner Trish Duggan's goals are to ""inspire, uplift, & educate."" She dedicates her museum to the Contemporary Studio Glass Movement. The gallery offers no designated area for Florida glassmiths, although the museum does have a handful of Sunshine State gaffers scattered throughout.

The lone disappointment I had w/ this wonderful museum is that the woman responsible today for getting visitors started on their self-journey did not appear to know much about the museum or its displays & artists; that was unfortunate. 

Upon entering the business, you'll be treated to the lobby which holds the work of one artist (Karen Lamonte-- floating kimono series), along w/ a check-in area & a gift shop; the shop offers jewelry, bowls, vases, nightlights, books, kids discovery toy & art kits, along w/ other glass & glass-related items. Prices are standard for this type of gift shop-- definitely not inexpensive, although there are some lower-priced items, especially for children-- see pics. There's also a donation box. 

Masks, gloves, & hand santitizer are available (free).

I will return...SOON. I'll bring along a tent & s'mores if they'll let me. This museum is truly I*N*C*R*E*D*I*B*L*E.",2020-10-11 00:09:30

Not only does it have cute photo opportunities but there are holiday-themed cocktails and so many beautiful Christmas decorations. When we went there was a 5$ cover charge which we were not expecting since the ""Nightmare Before Tinsel"" pop-up did not have any cover. If you are looking for a Christmas spirited bar then the 5$ is worth it.

Qa5MBgb7Xyrr9Pg5bD4taQ,5,"My secret to finding good food often starts by just seeing how long the line at the restaurant.  Barrio Bread take this to a new level, with locals lining up almost an hour early on a Saturday morning to be able to pick up this bread.  And regardless of how long you wait, it is still worth it! Even if you don't get the bread you originally wanted because you just can't go wrong with whatever you order.  

I have been multiple times and have enjoyed whatever I have picked up.  These breads make a fantastic pickup for any dinner and will impress as a gift to others.  My personal favorites are the Cinnamon Raisin and the Heritage loaves.  I've probably bought 10 different loaves of bread from them and have never been disappointed.

M1cMsRL4L7IUr9RILDywEQ,4,"5 stars for the Bonte waffle, 3 stars for this location. It's amazing they can get away with putting crack in their waffles but they do, at least that's what it must be because it was so addictive and delicious that even when I was full I wanted another. No syrup is nessassary for these bundles of joy that can be enjoyed on the run on while you're sitting there. For those who haven't been to a Bonte they mix whatever you want into the batter (everything is fresh) and roll it in sugary bits before putting it in the waffle machine. The prices are pretty reasonable and though they don't have a huge selection outside of the waffles they are good enough to sustain  Bonte on their own. 

This location, outside of being tiny has problems keeping basic things in stock like fruit for their waffles and knifes (both of which are common items you need for a lot of the options here). I don't know how they let those kind of things run out, poor management I guess.",2009-03-03 20:59:10

I've had family live on South Street for many years now. so going here has been a must 24/7. not for the food, not for the service (which is actually pretty damn good on most nights). but simply for the tradition of catching up with old friends and reliving some good moments over coffee and a warm plate of eggs. and when it comes to doing so this place is the best.",2007-07-27 20:12:11
bJ5FtCtZX3ZZacz2_2PJjA,4,"When I first heard that the Peace A Pizza (https://www.yelp.com/biz/peace-a-pizza-ardmore-2) were embracing the fast casual movement and making custom pies possible faster than ever before, I loved the idea. Especially when I found out that they were opening a Philly location in the spot that used to house my beloved burger joint 500 Degrees (https://www.yelp.com/biz/500-degrees-philadelphia-3). And after a couple of visits I can say that I'm happy with the end result overall.

Ultimately I give 4 stars because there's another nearby fast casual pizza joint that delivers pies slightly better (&Pizza review coming later). I also find the huge wooden serving blocks that they give you when you order in to be kind of awkward to handle, especially when you come in during a lunch or dinner rush. But when it comes down to it I'm impressed with the number of specialty pies, grain bowls, and salads that they're able to dish out, and liked the selection of New Hope fountain sodas that you were able to grab with free refills. 

For my first visit I ordered the appropriately named Kennett Square, a delicious pie that didn't disappoint with its medley of local roasted mushrooms, crumbled goat cheese, herb butter, and shredded mozzarella. For my second visit I was craving meat, and got it with a trio of pepperoni, sweet Italian sausage, and veal meatballs on their Sweet n' Slow pie!

ua6QuBe6mar6pDrhHETzJQ,2,"Ok, I have to say, after living on this block for 4 months and passing by this place I finally walked in on a whim today for lunch with friends because it was so convenient.

One of my crew immediately noticed that there were no lunch specials (odd for a Japanese restaurant not to have bento lunches of some kind no?) so there was the motion to leave immediately after sitting down. A couple of us were not in the mood to move, so we did not second the motion. Alas...here is the scoop:

The fish was good but a few of our pieces of sashimi were icy (not a good thing yeah, since sashimi should not be frozen).

This was the tiniest sashimi I have ever had in my entire life. I'm talking really thin and really small. Like toddler size bites.

The (spider, spicy tuna, rainbow) rolls were basically ok, nothing near fantastic. 2 of the 3 rolls were webbed with a sauce, and, I would suggest, the abundant criss-cross with mayo-based sauce was excessive and simply decorative--it actually took away from the taste of the rolls.

Looking at the menu, I was ok with the prices. But, given the size of the portions, I would suggest that this was way overpriced. I mean, I did not leave hungry but became so pretty quickly. I've given this $$$ because the portions were so small I would need to spend that much to feel satisfied.",2008-12-15 23:18:27

fLTm9wRlUBEMqg0puABOTQ,4,"On the recommendation of a friend who knew I loved Philly Cheesesteaks, Cindi and I ate at the New York Richie's in Enterprise, Oregon a few years ago.  My friend was right - the cheesesteaks were among the best we've had outside of Philly and New York, and we were disappointed to find the next time we visited Enterprise that New York Richie's had closed that location.

So you can imagine my excitement when Cindi called me on the way home from work one evening a few weeks ago to tell me there was a New York Richie's sign at the old Round Table / Atza pizza location on Glenwood Street across from Hawks Stadium.  According to some posts on the Oregon New York Richie's Facebook page, there was no business connection between the Idaho and Oregon New York Richie's locations, but the food would be the same.  We stopped in today, their second day of business, to see just how close the food came to what we had enjoyed so much in Enterprise.

I'm happy to report that we were not disappointed.  The cheesesteaks were as good as we remembered - the meat was tender and flavorful, with just the right amount of grilled onions, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, and Swiss and provolone cheeses.  The bread was fresh and chewy, as good as we've had in Philly, if a little smaller in diameter than authentic Philly steaks.  The fries were crispy and well seasoned, and included Richie's trademark chipotle fry sauce.  While we were eating, we saw a monster 20"" thin crust cheese pizza make its way to the next table, and made a mental note that we had to try the pizza on our next visit.

Our only disappointments:  First, the price.  At $8.95 for a sandwich with no fries, Richie's is charging $2-3 more than Philly prices for their steaks.  (In fairness, the pizza prices seemed very reasonable, starting at $16.50 for the 20"" cheese pizza.)  Secondly, any place that claims to serve genuine Philly cheesesteaks needs to have Cheez Whiz available as a topping option.

But all in all, we're happy as can be to finally have a real cheesesteak available in Boise.",2011-05-01 02:12:35

The dishes I have tried are always rather flavorful with those spices and delicious.

For lunch buffet though, I wouldn't rave about it as they are your usual Indian restaurant buffet food. The selections were somewhat narrower compared to other places.. The quality is not as good as the dishes you get for dinner - smaller plates make a big difference.

L_fdAnrH5Pxi4PqF08_ToA,5,"My sister and I went on the ghost tour with Theresa. Our group was really small (6 people), probably because it was a Tuesday night and it was also pretty cold out. That was fine by me as we didn't have to squeeze against each other on the sidewalk or crane our necks to hear what Theresa was saying. 

Theresa was an awesome guide. She knows her stuff and had a really positive attitude and fun personality. (Our group consisted of kind of ""blah"" people who didn't show any enthusiasm or ask questions, so extra points to her for staying upbeat!)

Also, I feel like it's worth mentioning that I am a total skeptic when it comes to haunted/ghost stuff. This tour didn't change my mind or anything, but I still found it really interesting and enjoyable!",2018-12-10 16:31:32
-AkziDwQ8hv2COTDBBUpig,3,"Philly has become a dangerous place with the most murders per capita than any other big city. 2,300 shot last year. 94 car jackings in 2022 already. Not unexpected when the police have been defunded by 33 million. That said, my daughter and her friends still wanted to go to the Fillmore for a concert. College kids always think they're invincible.  
So, that they wouldn't have to park and walk around, my wife and I dropped them all off and we drove over to Rivers, which was just a few blocks away.  It's very different compared to AC casinos. Not a hotel. More of a big sports bar with gaming. TVs Everywhere. FREE PARKING! 
Local  Philly business killing laws requires proof of vax and ID to get in.  So, like all Philly restaurants, which are suffering greatly, Rivers was pretty empty. I guess the locals listened when Kamala in 2020, said she wouldn't get the vaccine.  Maybe Philadelphians are all going to AC. Less restrictions. 
  The staff was great. Dinner at Jacks bar and grill was OK. Only 3 restaurants where open. Oddly, there was an Asian gaming section. Signs directed one to the Asian section. A private business has a right to do what they want, but could you imagine the outrage if there was a Caucasian section with only white dealers, white croupiers, white pit bosses and white waitresses? 
They had a band playing near the main bar, which was nice. Oh, driving through Philly, never saw one cop or cop car.",2022-01-18 03:48:44

Seriously, I did belong to a gym and would occasionally go but I never knew how to use most of the equipment. The gym rats would scowl if you asked them a question so I would usually just stick with the eliptical.However, it is way different at KoKo Fit Club!!!

You stay on one machine the entire time and the computer guides you through all the various exercises - ANY ONE CAN DO THIS! They have made exercise simple and fun. Not to mention the program is designed to be in and out in 30 minutes!

cTozFTTWjlFYc3yusdbZmA,1,"Just average Thai food tonight. Bangkok has always been my go to for Thai food but not anymore. We ordered the eggplant, the basil, and the combination noodles. All 3 dishes had the same watery sauce, red and green bell pepper and onion; tiny pieces of eggplant, almost zero basil, or noodle to make each dish different from the other. The stuffed chicken wing appetizer was not a favorite either. The sizzling platter was disappointing too with not enough spinach.  It was so good in the past. Unfortunately short cuts and are being made. Plus they overcharged us by charging for 2 sizzling platters when we ordered 1. When this was supposedly corrected the total bill came out to be $10 less. How does this make sense??? Did I still pay tax for 2nd sizzling platter? And shouldn't half of $27 be less $13.50 not $10? I don't think I'll be returning any time soon.",2022-01-18 06:42:59

Upsides: 
Childcare is included in the membership! 
The pool is well designed for lap swimmers! 
The showers are HOT and they have soap at each station. 
They appear to provide towels (Not sure exactly about this) 
The Spa is plenty hot
They appear to have most of the machines you'd want for lifting weights 
Staff is friendly

Downsides: 
The lockers are rusted out (All of them) 
The tops of the lockers are coated in dust (All of them)
The steam room isn't very hot, nor was it clean (18+ only) 
The spa doesn't allow anyone under 18 in it (see freezing children cold from the pool)
The showers are in the hallway that everyone has to travel to reach the pool 
The floors are visibly dirty (even in the mandatory feet only area's) 

This is an older facility. It feels old in its design and function. Millennial types will likely abhor its lack of privacy in the locker rooms. 

But when it comes down to it, everything you need is here and with a little effort on your part it can be great (see clean).",2016-01-25 21:45:34

MCzlzlOw7IGbRAKVjJBPtg,3,"This is a good pizza option - they deliver through GrubHub and a few other services.  I use the 3 star/ A-OK rating because we live in Philadelphia and the pizza scene here is strong.  Would I order from Slice again? Yes.  Would I go out of my way to do so?  No.  

With that said, I ordered four pies for a work lunch - a cheese, a sausage, a meatball, and a Pizza Bruschetta.  The Pizza Bruschetta was the clear winner - everyone loved it.  Their meatball pizza was also very tasty, but the meatballs looked dry which threw me off for a minute. 

They use a thinner crust, so you can eat more pizza....or at least that's the excuse I'm going to use for the number of slices I had. 

So, all in all, give it a try if you're nearby or need delivery in the Rittenhouse Square area.  Doooo it.",2018-03-13 13:54:48
x1QLCwZGFAjxRRw4EHc3-g,5,"Don't misinterpret my 5-star review....I don't think Wendy's is a good substitute for the amazing family-owned restaurants located in the area. The 5 stars is solely related to the fact that this is the BEST Wendy's I have ever been to.

When I'm super lazy (which is most days), I go through the drive thru for a quick dinner on my ride home. No matter how many cars are in the drive thru lane, they seem to process them like a machine. The staff are always friendly and my food comes out hot.

A few weeks ago, I decided to venture inside. It felt like I had landed in outer space. I have NEVER seen such a fancy Wendy's. There is a two-sided fireplace with four upholstered chairs on one side. They also have TV, free wifi, and a soda machine that makes 100s of sodas.

RKPkxOYQlM0BjhM-H6_vAw,4,"Good, maybe very good.  I went for lunch, so the head chef wasn't there, so this review may be a bit biased.  I see Marhaba as a 3.5-star eatery, but I'll round up due to the dearth of Lebanese/Egyptian food in the area, and I did not have the owner/head chef present, so I'm sure things would be ticked up a half point were he available in the kitchen.

First off, the location is kind of cool off the river, but the restaurant is small on the borderline annoying side.  Tables are quite close together.  There were only about three other tables occupied when we went for lunch, and one server covered the whole shift.  There was one young guy as a chef working the kitchen.  He seemed good, but I didn't get the sense that the dishes were special as if the owner were present.  Someone with some background and skill put together this wonderful menu.

Service is chillax in a good way.  My DP and I sampled a few things off the menu and found everything good, but there were no wows per se (i.e. not a 5-star eatery).  

Marhaba does its own take on a number of Lebanese dishes, but still have a lot of core items and dipping sauces, which I liked very much.  The portions are large, which the menu mentions.  I found them overly large, tbh.

Here's what I had:

Kaffa Brad - they serve this freshly puffed, and it's quite good.  I'm used to it being served with hummus or salatim, which wasn't the case here.  It was just a stack of very good bread.  I think a lot of people would like this though.

Lentil Soup with Fried Onions - Very rich, tasty dish.  I liked the spices and they added some heat.  The fried onions added a savory element and a different texture, although once they soaked up the soup they lost their crispness.

Chicken Schwarma Platter - So good.  Chicken was tender and well spiced and a very large portion to boot.  I thought the yellow saffron rice was too flavorful and crowded out some of the chicken flair.  I'm used to the chicken being served a top white basmati rice, which may flow together a bit more naturally.  The side Mediterranean salad was nice and bright, although I'm not as big on olive oil as most.  The chicken schwarma came with two sauces, tahini and a garlic, very classic.  I added their famous green hot sauce since I'm a sucker for some kick.  All were great and tasted homemade.

My DP got the lamb gyro, which was tasty, very meaty and came on a fresh pita.  He had some sauce envy, however, when he saw my accompaniments.

Next time I might try the lamb chops or lamb kebab to see how juicy they push their proteins.

One other note, try not to sit by the door in the winter, as the draft can be cumbersome.  Prices are inexpensive.  It's BYOB.",2015-01-23 23:52:03

YwAMC-jvZ1fvEUum6QkEkw,5,"For when I'm feeling like ignoring my calorie-counting, and indulging in a flavor blowout, Sauce On the Side has become one of my favorite DoorDash delights. 

So! These are the best calzones, hands down, t hat I've ever eaten. Crust is flavorful and baked to that golden-brown, crispy-chewy perfection that satisfies the soul. And there isn't *too much* of it -- it's always perfectly filled, to every single corner, with melty, gooey, cheesy goodness. It comes with a variety of truly homemade-tasting sauces, all of which I'd be proud to have made myself, from the simple garlic butter to the roasted-tomato smoky goodness of the thick red sauce. 

But the standout, here, is the fillings. Creative and epic combinations, combining sweet and savory, spicy and creamy, rich and fresh and smoky... again, these are characteristics I seek in my own kitchen, my own recipes, which I take a great deal of pride in. 

So! Last night His Goatness and I binged on the Carmen, the Figgy Piggy, and the Garden. 

The Carmen: Prosciutto, Capicola, Spinach, Parmesan, Fontina, Ricotta, Garlic Oil. So much flavor, even from the various cheeses, and the garlic oil wasn't buried... it allowed a perfect melding of flavor, with a bit of freshness from the spinach. Warm and creamy. Served with garlicky garlic butter. 

The Figgy Piggy: Applewood Smoked Bacon, Figs, Balsamic Onions, Garlic Herb Cheese, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Garlic Honey Oil. Dear gods, I love the combination of figs, balsamic onions, and bacon. The perfect blend of sweet and savory... this was far and away my favorite, and will be a treat I savor many times in the future. It was served, again, with simple garlic butter, allowing the ingredients to shine -- I didn't use it. It wasn't necessary. There wasn't too much crust. 

The Garden: Balsamic Eggplant, Spinach, Zucchini, Roasted Garlic, White Onions, Snow Peas, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Garlic Oil. I substituted artichoke hearts for snow peas -- the snow peas (which I do love) didn't seem quite in harmony with the Mediterranean ingredients. They were generous with the artichoke hearts, and the whole thing came together flawlessly. It was served with their smoky, thick ""House Red"" sauce, which complemented the calzone marvelously. 

A blowout binge that was worth. Every. Calorie. Every single one.",2022-01-19 18:59:27
6JehEvdoCvZPJ_XIxnzIIw,3,"Located in the 'Walking District' in Nashville, it's was a bit out of the way for us, but we were on a mission to experience the proclaimed 'Greatest burger in Nashville'. 

The menu includes several burgers, wursthen, and chicken sandwich options. The waitress told us that The Farm Burger is the most popular. I for one have never had a burger with an egg and the thought of it isn't very appealing. 

I ended up ordering the 'Pharmacy Burger', which is a less cheesier version of their 'Cheese Burger' that my husband ordered. They LOADED the mustard, but that really wasn't what I didn't like about it. It really wasn't that I disliked the burger, it just wasn't anywhere near one of the best burgers that I've had. The extra toppings at fifty cents each are pretty skimpy too. I was a fan of the wasabi aioli though. I also loved the tater tots though. I highly recommend ordering tater tots over the french fries. The beer cheese dipping sauce was an extra dollar and was borderline disgusting. Stick with wasabi aioli. 

I'm thinking that the toppings and sauces are possibly what the hype about this place is, otherwise, I just don't get it. To describe this place in one word... overhyped.",2018-01-02 22:50:47
